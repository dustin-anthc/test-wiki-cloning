Appendix I:  Additional Considered Standards and Requirements
=============================================================

**Introduction:** This document outlines some of the other possible software standards and requirements that were evaluated but ultimately not adopted.  The reasons for non-adoption are given for reference in case there are future questions and/or potential standard updates.

Some of the following also represent areas where AKWarm residential energy modeling software has either not been tested or has not met the qualifications. These can be used as a starting point for additional testing or software updates that may be needed for approval for use in national programs.

**Section I:  ASHRAE 140**

-   **Requirement:** *Space Cooling*

-   **Reason Not Adopted:** Alaska has very few installed space cooling systems in residential homes.  For this reason, it was considered an unnecessary burden to software developers to require modeling options for Alaska-specific space cooling. Software that incorporates space cooling would not be barred from approval. Incorporation of Alaska-specific space cooling testing parameters, or third-party verification of meeting the national standards, represents a high level of testing for a feature that has very little effect in Alaska.

**Section II:  RESNET Standards**

-   **Requirement:** *Auto-generating reference homes.* RESNET has a requirement that software prove that it can auto-generate the correct reference homes.

-   **Reason Not Adopted:** Any potential errors that would be caused by inappropriate generation of reference homes by other software should be identified by the Alaska test modeling procedure that is outlined in the *Alaska Home Energy Rating Software Approval Guidelines*.  This additional set of tests would be duplicative and unnecessarily burdensome

-   **Requirement:** *HVAC Tests:* RESNET requires that energy rating software go through a battery of tests to verify the accuracy and consistency with which software predicts the performance of HVAC equipment.

-   **Reason Not Adopted:** The *Alaska Home Energy Rating Software Approval Guidelines* already requires that applicant software programs must model improvements to a series of test buildings’ HVAC system in several scenarios.  These test models must fall within a specified range of values in order to be certified.  We feel that if software meets this requirement, it should not also be required to go through an additional battery of HVAC tests.

-   **Requirement:** *Duct Distribution system efficiency tests.*  RESNET requires that software undergo a series of tests to ensure the air distribution system losses are accurately calculated.  

-   **Reason Not Adopted:**   Residential duct distribution systems in Alaska are typically located within the conditioned space. Requiring that software programs undergo testing to ensure that the modeling is accurate using Alaska-specific options would not provide benefits equal to the additional time and expense.


-   **Requirement:** *Hot water system performance tests.*  RESNET requires a series of tests to determine if software is accurately modeling domestic hot water energy use.

-   **Reason Not Adopted:**  Estimated energy use for domestic hot water plays a significant role in the Alaska Home Energy Rating Score.  In order to ensure that future Alaska Energy Rating Scores are consistent regardless of the software used, the *Alaska Home Energy Rating Software Approval Guidelines* require that hot water energy use be calculated using a default amount of hot water per person, per day.  Additionally, the guidelines require that water heater improvements be modeled and fall within a required range.  The authors feel that these two requirements are sufficient to ensure that hot water usage is being accurately calculated, and recommend that this additional battery of tests not be adopted.

**Section III:  IECC 2015**

-   **Requirement:** *HVAC Part Load Ratios*.  The 2015 IECC section 405.6.1.3 requires that calculations account for part-load ratios on the performance of HVAC equipment based on the climate and equipment sizing.  

-   **Reason Not Adopted:**  Currently Alaska’s building energy efficiency standards are based on 2012 IECC. This section of IECC 2015 represents a significant change from 2012. Since it is above and beyond the current standard, it is not adopted as a requirement for software certification at this time. Investigation is needed before determining if this type of modeling can be done accurately and if so, if the effects on modeled energy usage and costs in Alaska are significant enough to justify additional requirements in the certification process.

**Section IV:  PassivHaus Standard**

While the PassivHaus standard provides a meaningful framework for determining the energy efficiency of homes, it does not currently include standards that it uses to determine whether energy modeling software is accurate or not.  For this reason, it was not included in the *Alaska Home Energy Rating Software Approval Guidelines.*
