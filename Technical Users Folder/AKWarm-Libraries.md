# AKWarm Libraries

This section describes the contents of the various libraries that AKWarm uses to support its energy, rating, and improvement calculations.  The frequency of update for the libraries varies, with some highly variable libraries such as the energy and utility costs being updated twice a year and others, such as framing types, being updated much less regularly.

## Improvement Options

#### Energy Efficiency Improvements Cost Library

The Alaska-specific [improvement cost library](../wiki/Images/Appendices/AppendixC.xlsx) is used when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of recommended energy efficiency measures.

This library gives a range of costs for a wide variety of specific energy efficiency measures. These costs include all materials, labor, and equipment for each measure. Within Alaska, installation costs for energy efficiency measures vary widely due to transportation requirements, availability of skilled labor, and other market forces. For this reason, each community has been assigned a relative cost factor, which can be found in the [Community Cost Factors Library](../wiki/Images/Appendices/AppendixD.xlsx).

The improvement cost library was created using bid costs from Weatherization Agencies working throughout the state as well as information from various Alaskan suppliers and installers.  Note that there are no default costs for air sealing work, as the time and effort to air seal varies significantly based on the quality of the home and other factors.  

#### Estimated Life of Energy Efficiency Measures

The expected life of an energy efficiency measure will affect the life cycle cost-benefit analysis calculations. AKWarm uses the estimated life expectancy figures in the [improvement cost library](../wiki/Images/Appendices/AppendixC.xlsx) for each energy efficiency measure when calculating life cycle costs.  The estimated lives in this section are derived from generally accepted engineering estimates from ASHRAE. 

#### Shell Improvements

The shell improvement library includes a variety of energy efficiency measures that can be evaluated to determine if they are cost effective or not.  Each measure has an associated location (attic, walls, etc.), insulation type (fiberglass, blown cellulose, etc.), R-value, and whether the component is being replaced or if more insulation is being added.

## Building Components

#### Insulation

The AKWarm insulation library includes a variety of different insulating materials.  Each material has information on whether it is a batt-type insulation, the thickness of the batt, the R-value per inch, and common insulation amounts.  Generally, this library requires little updating except to add new insulation products and variations as they enter the market.  

#### Framing

#### Windows & Doors

#### Heating & Cooling Systems

#### Domestic Hot Water Systems

#### Lights & Appliances



## Fuel & Utility Costs

#### Fuel Cost Library

The Alaska-specific [fuel cost library](../wiki/Images/Appendices/AppendixB.xlsx) is used for estimating total energy costs and for energy cost savings from energy efficiency measures. These costs are updated biannually and are derived primarily from the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development’s *Alaska Fuel Price Report: Current Community Conditions.* 

#### Utility Cost Library

[Electricity and natural gas costs](../wiki/Images/Appendices/AppendixB.xlsx) are also updated biannually and are obtained from the Alaska Energy Authority’s *Power Cost Equalization Program: Statistical Data by Community* and other published utility rates in Alaska. Electricity prices include estimated demand charges and differentiate between subsidized Power Cost Equalization (PCE) prices and unsubsidized prices depending on whether estimated monthly usage exceeds the PCE program's monthly 500 kWh limit. Additionally, the Regulatory Commission of Alaska’s surcharge for both electricity and natural gas is factored in to all energy cost estimates.

#### Energy Cost Escalation Factors

Energy cost escalation factors are used when calculating the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency measures. These factors are taken from the most recent version of the [National Institute of Standards and Technology’s](www.nist.gov) *Energy Price Indices and Discount Factors for Life-Cycle Cost Analysis: Table Ca-4*. The 2013 version of these numbers for Census Region 4 are located in the [Fuel Escalation Factor section](../wiki/Images/Appendices/AppendixE.xlsx).  Note that these factors are *not* based on a constant annual percentage growth.
