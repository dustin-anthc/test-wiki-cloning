_<H4>Special Hydro and source BTU’s in AKWarm</H4>_

The energy used by a building at the site of the building has often incurred conversion, transmission and distribution losses before reaching the building. In order to reflect these losses and also to reflect the fact that some energy forms are of higher quality and more valuable than other energy forms, source-to-site multiplicative factors are applied to the energy used by the building before adding together the energy used from multiple fuel types.

AKWarm uses source BTU’s. For rating purposes only, the energy use in MMBTUs is evaluated in relation to the source of the fuel. For each energy source other than electricity, the BTUs/unit for that actual fuel is used. For electricity, the source is considered as either gas or oil, unless the home is located in a city that has hydropower as its source of electricity.

Six Special Hydro cities were designated by Steve Baden in 1994, during the initial phase of preliminary AKWarm development. Juneau, Haines, Sitka, Wrangell/Petersburg, Ketchikan and Kodiak we granted this designation. They were, at the time supplied with ample capacity of hydroelectric power. Over the years that supply has ebbed and flowed with changing populations, industry and residential loads. The site to source multipliers are shown below. Since that time AHFC uses the Alaska Energy Statistics published by AEA to determine cities with a substantial hydroelectric generation capacity. If the city has over 90% of its capacity from hydro/renewables, it becomes a “special Hydro” city.

##### Site-to-Source BTU Multipliers

| Fuel          | Multiplier |
|:--------------|-----------:|
| Electricity   | 3          |
| Natural Gas   | 1          |
| Propane       | 1          |
| \#1 Oil       | 1          |
| \#2 Oil       | 1          |
| Birch         | 0.8        |
| Spruce        | 0.8        |
| Coal          | 1          |
| Special Hydro | 1.5        |

The values used for some of these factors are influenced by policy considerations.  For example, the “Special Hydro” Electricity factor is applied for use of electricity in certain communities that acquire all or nearly all of their electricity from hydroelectric resources.  Because the Special Hydro source multiplier is 1.5 and the normal electricity multiplier is 3.0, use of electricity for water and space heating is not discouraged as much in these communities.  The current list of Special Hydro communities with over 90% hydro/renewables is:

Craig, Douglas, Haines, Juneau, Kasaan, Ketchikan, Klawock, Kodiak, Petersburg, Sitka, Skagway, Thorne Bay, Ward Cove, Wrangell, Metlakatla, Larsen Bay

The practical effect of this multiplier is that homes rated with a source multiplier of 1 become the reference. Source multipliers of greater than one are multiplied by that amount to determine overall btu use. Less than 1 as a multiplier gives a credit for renewable energy systems.

The wood fuel types--Birch, and Spruce--receive source multipliers of 0.8, multipliers that are clearly not consistent with the concept of accounting for harvesting and transportation energy use.  However, these favorable multipliers were chosen to encourage the use of wood, which is generally a renewable resource.  Also, the low multipliers also reflect the lower quality of this fuel source; natural gas and fuel oil heating equipment have higher efficiencies than wood heating equipment because of the higher quality of those fuel types.
The District Steam and Hot Water energy types were given relatively favorable treatment because the heat source for these fuel types is often waste heat from an electricity generator.
