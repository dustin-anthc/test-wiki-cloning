A. IRS Energy Efficient Home Credit IRC Section 45L and List of Eligible Software Programs for Certification

1.  **Introduction**

This project is presented to the Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC) by the Alaska Building Science Network (ABSN). Its purpose is to assist CCHRC in its advisory relationship with the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AFHC) to decide the best course of action with regards to choosing a software package for AHFC’s Home Energy Program. The project was authorized by CCHRC contract number 2007-04 for AKWarm Program Evaluation.

Since 1995 AFHC’s Home Energy Rating Program has used the locally developed AKWarm software which, when it was written it was on the cutting edge of energy analysis software. Besides being easy to learn, it was capable of providing outputs for a variety of users and purposes including residential building energy load calculations, weatherization retrofit economics, energy ratings, energy-efficient mortgages, and compliance testing for ’s Building Energy Efficiency Standard (BEES). It tested remarkably well against the more robust DOE2 energy modeling program and was approved by secondary lenders and the EPA Energy Star program. AkWarm was designed for a Windows-based computer with a “386” microprocessor and 5 MB of free disk space. In the intervening years, while the Microsoft operating systems have changed numerous times, AkWarm has been virtually error-free and has been used to perform over 25,000 energy ratings and energy use simulations. While there have been a number of attempts to update the program, the version 1.03d that was put in place in 1995 is still being used today with no significant changes other than the in the database libraries. Meanwhile there have been a number of changes in the world of residential energy programs:

-   In 2002 a national non-profit organization, Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET), was incorporated to develop national standards for home energy ratings. RESNET has also developed a program for certifying energy rating tools, including performance compliance software programs and rater training programs. RESNET has been an integral part of the development of the Federal government’s residential energy rating and tax credit programs. *Neither AkWarm nor AHFC’s Home Energy Rating Program have been certified by RESNET*.

-   In July 2005 Congress passed the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The legislation provided for a $2000 tax credit to builders for building energy efficient homes. To meet the tax credit requirements, a home must use no more than 50% of the energy used by a home built to 2004 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) standards. The only way to determine if a home will qualify for the tax credit is to have an analysis done using one of the approved IRS software programs. Software approval must be provided by RESNET or “an equivalent rating network”. *AkWarm has not yet been approved for tax credit certification by any agency*.

-   On November 8, 2006, BEES 1991 was replaced (with the adoption by reference in 15 AAC 155.010) by BEES-2007, which includes the residential provisions of the 2006 IECC, ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2004, and Alaska-specific amendments to both of those documents. The standard update became effective on . In order to continue to use AkWarm for showing compliance AHFC’s BEES-2007, the AkWarm reference home library must be recalibrated to create a reference house that meets this new set of criteria. *Currently new homes with foundations poured on or after are not in compliance if they rely on the Four Star Plus (83 point) AKWarm energy rating.*

-   Since the initial development of AkWarm, personal computers and the range of programs they can support have made it possible to take advantage of more complex energy simulations, and to provide a wider array of output reports. While AkWarm focused on the home’s thermal energy use, today’s home energy analysis programs can also evaluate lighting and appliances, indoor air quality, “green-ness”, and provide room-by-room heating and ventilation designs. This is especially important for Energy Star certified homes and homes seeking certification under a green building standard. In the past, AKWarm Five Star homes were automatically considered to meet the EPA’s Energy Star requirements. However, those requirements changed significantly in July 2006 and now include lighting and appliance elements. *AKWarm Five Star homes no longer meet Energy Star requirements.*

-   The trend for some Home Energy Rating programs (and part of the new RESNET standard) has changed from a zero to 100 point scale where the upper end reflects the most efficient homes to a scale where zero points represent a zero-energy use home. The goal then is to get as close to zero points as possible. With the new system higher points represent excessive energy use. Most of the newer energy rating programs are keyed to this new standard. There is certainly controversy about which method is better, but the direction seems to be toward the new system. *AKWarm is still based on a zero to 100 point scale.*

-   Changes in the Microsoft Windows operating system have occurred many times over the last decade or so. AKWarm has weathered these changes without harm and has functioned well through the current Windows XL systems. This may not be the case with Microsoft’s newest operating system – Windows Vista. It appears that no one has yet been successful getting AKWarm to work with Windows Vista. This is not only an issue for current uses but also for access to the thousands of archived AKWarm ratings. *As users upgrade their computer systems to Windows AKWarm will no longer be functional.*

-   The library that is used in AKWarm was created in an antique version of Microsoft Access (2.0). It will only operate and it can only be modified using that version. There may only be one computer in that still has this version operating! Later versions of Access do not work with AKWarm. *The AKWarm library structure needs to be brought into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.*

Clearly, the time has come for change. The question at hand is: should the State of Alaska move forward with updating and enhancing AkWarm or would it be more economically and logistically feasible to adapt one of the currently certified programs to meet Alaska’s needs in terms of BEES-2007 compliance, Federal tax credits, and other institutional requirements. Our task will be to perform the research and examination necessary to help CCHRC and AHFC make this decision.

Principal work on this project was done by Ginny Moore of Flattop Technical Services (345-1355; <tgmoore@gci.net>) and Geoff Feiler of Heat Loss Analysis (563-0773; <hla@alaska.net>) . Questions regarding this project can be addressed to them directly or via the ABSN office (562-9927; <absn@alaska.net>).

1.  **Scope of Work**

In the original proposal presented to CCHRC, ABSN outlined six task areas including:

-   *Characterizing the existing AKWarm software* which involved identifying the existing users and uses of AKWarm. This was accomplished in part by reviewing previous comments made by the largest user group - AHFC Energy Raters – and by relying on the expertise of the researchers who have been involved with ’s energy rating programs since their inceptions. The second significant user group – weatherization providers – was also interviewed to identify their needs and collect their recommendations.

-   *Defining necessary and desirable changes to the AKWarm software* has been given replaced with a more general effort to define a list of features that should be available in any software package chosen to represent AHFC’s program. We already have several lists of desirable AKWarm improvements that have been developed over the last twelve years.

-   *Creating a matrix of specifications* was initially intended to provide a way to compare and possibly rank five or six packages. The matrix was developed early in the project and submitted to CCHRC for review and comment. As research into the available programs progressed, it has become obvious that some of the options do not have what we considered to be minimum feature requirements. Therefore the final review may contain only two or three programs.

-   *Determining which software programs to evaluate* was a rather simple task since the number of available programs is quite limited. For tax credit purposes, the software must be approved by RESNET or an equivalent rating network. Review of other potential packages was requested either by CCHRC or selected based on the researcher’s knowledge of them.

-   *Evaluating AKWarm and other programs* has required the bulk of the effort. We have not needed to evaluate AKWarm because we are intimately familiar with its capabilities and shortcomings. We only need to report them. The other programs have required extensive review to determine if they can be made appropriate for , if they will provide the required features, if there is adequate support, and if the costs are reasonable.

-   *Summarizing and presenting courses of action* is the primary function of this report. We may present more than one course several of which will not be mutually exclusive. We will also present another issue that needs to be resolved with respect to the federal tax credits. This is an action that is independent of the software research but, if it is not resolved, the software selection will be moot as far as tax credits go.

> The bulk of the work on this project did not necessarily follow the initially proposed scope. It became evident early on that there were only a few programs that could meet our needs and that some of them did not, at this time, meet all the basic requirements. Early on we determined that the most useful software programs to evaluate for this project were REM/, EnergyGauge, TREAT, and 2000/3000.

1.  **Energy Program Requirements**

There are basic functions an energy software modeling program must provide in order to meet the requirements of the current AKWarm user groups. They are as follows:

-   *Energy ratings for BEES compliance*: the package must be able to create a reference home based on the 2006 International Energy Conservation Code and the amendments to that code and then compare that reference home to a model based on the actual building elements. The actual home must achieve a Four Star Plus energy rating which begins at 83 points on a zero to 100 point scale, unless we decide to change our general view of the point/star relationship. *Currently AKWarm is the only software package that meets that requirement.*

-   *Energy ratings for AHFC’s Interest Rate Reduction program*: currently homebuyers can get mortgage interest rate reductions (IRRs) by purchasing homes that either meet 5 Star/5 Star Plus requirements or that can be upgraded to show improvements in the energy rating system. In the latter case ratings are performed before and after improvements and the difference between the two determines amount of the rate reduction. *AKWarm is used for these purposes and other packages with improvement analysis capabilities should work as well but minor changes to AHFC’s mortgage guidelines may be necessary*.

-   *Improvement Options Reports (IOR)*: these are essential for some AHFC’s IRRs programs. They outline the improvements that can be made to a home so that the owners can evaluate their options. The reports present the upgrade items in order of cost-effectiveness. The IOR is also used by homeowners who just want ideas on how to make their homes more efficient even if they are not participating in an IRR program.

> Besides homeowners and homebuyers, the IOR is used heavily by ’s Low-Income Weatherization providers. AKWarm has long been an important tool for these organizations and the IOR helps them prioritize their weatherization tasks. *Improvement option reports are offered by AKWarm, RemRate, and TREAT.*

-   *Design heating load calculations*: these are necessary for sizing heating systems in both new construction and retrofit situations. AKWarm is used by energy raters, architects, building designers, and others to perform this task. *All the software packages can do this but they do not all use the same climate data or calculation methods to achieve their results.*

-   *Federal energy tax credit certification*: as mentioned in the introduction, a $2000 Federal tax credit is available to builders who construct homes that are theoretically 50% more efficient the 2004 amendments to the 2003 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). Of the five software packages reviewed only two (RemRate and Energy Gauge) are currently approved by RESNET for tax credit purposes. TREAT has been submitted to RESNET for review. AKWarm has been denied approval and that denial is being appealed. HOT3000 is not yet far enough along to be submitted.

> A critical issue here is the perceived requirement that the software for the tax credits must be approved by RESNET. The IRS regulations actually give the options of approval as “by RESNET (or an equivalent rater network)”. This also holds true for the energy raters themselves. *The selection of a software package for energy rating program is moot if the persons performing the ratings are not also certified by RESNET or “an equivalent rating network”.*
>
> So what is an “equivalent rating network”? The Alaska Building Science Network has managed to contact the IRS attorney who actually wrote the regulation. So far there is no answer. This attorney has passed the question on to her superiors but has said to not expect an answer until maybe October.

-   *Customer and software support*: this is a critical element for any software package. Not only do the users need to supported, but the software itself should be continuously reviewed, updated, and improved. The support systems for RemRate and TREAT appear to be first-rate, possibly a bit less so for Energy Gauge. HOT3000, being a small part of a large government organization, even less (it took about five phone calls to even find someone who knew about the program). For AKWarm, there have been regular library updates as well as customer support on usage issues, but no effective efforts at keeping the package current.

1.  **User Desired Features**

For a full service package, failure to meet all of the Alaska Energy Program Requirements should mean automatic removal from consideration unless those deficiencies are soon to be corrected. Beyond those elements there are a wide range of features, the inclusion of which can make a program more desirable. Some of the more important are:

-   *User friendliness*: AKWarm is noted for this. Most of the other programs require a far greater number of inputs including walls by orientation and windows by size, wall association and placement on a wall. However, despite require greater detail in some areas, they are less flexible than AKWarm in others.

-   *Flexible and useful report capabilities*: Akwarm produces only a couple reports. All of the other packages provide (or will provide in pending versions) a wide variety of outputs including energy ratings, tax credit compliance reports, proper input reflections, VA/FHA requirements, and a variety of code compliance options. With some, the user can custom-create reports.

-   *Broad weather database:* AKWarm has monthly average weather data for nearly all communities in . Other programs use 30-year average TMY data which is currently available for only 19 locations. If another program is chosen it would be good to find a way to simulate the rest of ’s communities in the TMY structure.

-   *Rating provider library & library support*: All of the programs have non-editable libraries for building components and some other features. They initially appear to be less detailed than AKWarm’s libraries. We would need to be able to add items to these databases without relying on the software provider. Also the AKWarm library is maintained by one person who is rapidly approaching senility in a database that can often be found in antique stores. A new system is essential.

-   *User-definable library*: Letting users create “unofficial” libraries is advantageous because it helps deal with items that don’t show up in the provider library. Currently, the AKWarm library is only updated once a year. User inputs could be useful in maintaining a list of future “official” library needs

-   *Ability to export house files*: This is essential for training and monitoring purposes. All of the reviewed packages have this capability even if their main file system is in a database rather than discrete house files.

-   *Ability to run more than one house at a time*: Users can only have one instance of AKWarm running on their computer at a time. The same holds for Energy Gauge. It would be nice to not have to close one house file in order to work on another.

**V. Energy Modeling Methods**

Many of the energy modeling/energy rating packages currently available use some type of third-party calculation engine. These are generally developed by government energy departments or large research organizations. The software the user buys is just a privately developed interface between the user and the calculation engine. The more common calculation engines are:

-   *DOE2*: Developed in part by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories (LBL), DOE-2 is a widely used and accepted freeware building energy analysis program that can predict the energy use and cost for all types of buildings. It uses a description of the building layout, construction components, operating schedules, conditioning systems, and utility rates along with weather data, to perform hourly building energy simulations and to estimate utility bills. The “plain” DOE-2 program is a “DOS box” or “batch” program which requires substantial experience to learn to use effectively while offering researchers and experts significant flexibility. DOE-2 is difficult to modify and is no longer supported by the U.S. Department of Energy. DOE-2 is used by Energy Gauge.

-   *EnergyPlus*: EnergyPlus models heating, cooling, lighting, ventilating, and other energy flows as well as water in buildings. While originally based on the most popular features and capabilities of DOE-2 and BLAST (an older simulation engine), EnergyPlus includes many innovative simulation capabilities such as time steps of less than an hour, modular systems and plant integrated with heat balance-based zone simulation, multizone air flow, thermal comfort, water use, natural ventilation, and photovoltaic systems. It is replacing DOE2 as the Department of Energy’s supported calculation engine but is complex and probably more appropriate for commercial building applications. It is not used by any of the reviewed rating software, but an upcoming version of TREAT may change that.

-   *SUNREL*: Created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), SUNREL is a also an hourly building energy simulation program that aids in the design of small energy-efficient buildings where the loads are dominated by the dynamic interactions between the building's envelope, its environment, and its occupants. The program is based on fundamental models of physical behavior and includes algorithms specifically for passive technologies, such as Trombe walls, programmable window shading, advanced glazings, and natural ventilation. In addition, a simple graphical interface aids in creating input files. SUNREL is relatively easy to modify, but changes must be done by NREL. It also has limited mechanical systems analysis capability. SUNREL is used by TREAT.

-   *ESP-r*: ESP-r was developed by the in and is an integrated modeling tool for the simulation of the thermal, visual and acoustic performance of buildings and the assessment of the energy use and gaseous emissions associated with the environmental control systems and construction materials. The system is equipped to model heat, air, moisture and electrical power flows at user determined resolution. The system is designed for the Unix operating system, with supported implementations for Solaris and Linux, and can operate under Windows. It is complex and also difficult to modify. ESP-r is used by HOT3000.

Besides the simulation engines noted above there are programs such as AKWarm, Micropas (used in ) and REM/RATE which use a correlation method for energy load calculations. In these programs there is not a separate calculation engine, the user interface, libraries, calculations, and outputs were developed symbiotically. There is at least one opinion that this type of modeling program is becoming obsolete because the power available in current computer technology make the more complex simulation programs easy to run.

**VI. Home Energy Rating System Point Issues**

Historically, energy rating scores have been on a 0 to 100 point scale with the upper end representing a home with minimal energy use. The lower end has been an arbitrarily determined level of energy use as a function of a reference home which matches the prescriptive requirements of an energy standard. The national HERS reference home is 80 points on the 0 to 100 scale (4 star). A rated home with the same annual energy requirements as its associated reference home would also score 80 points (houses rated at 80 points are also deemed to meet the requirements of the now defunct Model Energy Code). The old EPA Energy Star Homes program required a HERS score of 86 (5 star) to qualify. The HERS reference spread is as follows:

| **HERS Score** | **Stars** | **Energy Consumption**    |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| 0 to \<40      | 1         | \> 3.0x Reference Home    |
| 40 to \<60     | 2         | \> 2.0x to 3.0x Ref. Home |
| 60 to \<80     | 3         | \> 1.0x to 2.0x Ref. Home |
| 80 to \<86     | 4         | \> 0.7x to 1.0x Ref. Home |
| 86 to \<92     | 5         | \> 0.4x to 0.7x Ref. Home |
| 92 to 100      | 5+        | 0.0x to 0.4x Ref. Home    |

Until recently, the reference home for has been based on the 1992 Building Energy Efficiency Standard and was pegged at 83 points (Four Star Plus). The new standard is to be based on the 2006 IECC with amendments but still pegged at 83 points.

Beginning in 2006 the national HERS index changed from a 0 – 100 point scale to a 0 to 500 points scale with the lower end representing a zero-energy home. The upper end heads toward infinite energy use. The HERS reference home is 100 points on the indexing scale. A rated home with the same annual energy requirements as its associated reference home would also have an index of 100 points. The number of points one receives is the same as the relative amount of energy use. The lower the energy use the lower the rating points with the ultimate goal being zero points.

For HERS 2006 ratings indexes and star ratings correspond as follows:

| **Energy Use Relative to Index** | **Star Rating** |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| \<500% and \>400%                | 1               |
| =\<400% and \>300%               | 1+              |
| =\<300% and \>250%               | 2               |
| =\<250% and \>200%               | 2+              |
| =\<200% and \>150%               | 3               |
| =\<150% and \>0%                 | 3+              |
| =\<0% and \>-15%                 | 4               |
| =\<-15% and \>-30%               | 4+              |
| =\<-30% and \>-50%               | 5               |
| =\<-50% and \>=-100%             | 5+              |

1.  **Software Packages Reviewed**

After an exhaustive search on our own, we determined that the most useful software programs to evaluate for this project were REM/, EnergyGauge, TREAT, and 2000/3000.

We contacted others who are involved in energy rating software program evaluation and they agreed that our list was complete:

1.  Advanced Energy, in , looked at nine different programs for a comparison study, before narrowing it down to three programs. REM/Rate, TREAT and EnergyGauge were their winners with regard to ease of use and having the ability to predict different energy use with different foundation setups.  The others were either much more cumbersome or predicted the same energy use regardless of the changing foundation characteristics, or were specific to one location, e.g. . 

2.  Ron Judkoff, Director of Buildings & Thermal Systems Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, agreed that we were evaluating all of the useful programs. He did summarize his perceptions of the pros and cons of each program (note: he is a co-author of SUNREL, the simulation engine that is “under the hood” of TREAT).

A major effort was made to research the existing software packages that could be potential candidates for adoption by ’s energy programs. There was consistent agreement among developers and users nationwide that the programs that should be considered could be narrowed to:

1.  **REM/Rate v12.4**
    Architectural Energy Corporation
    2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201
    Boulder, CO 80301

> REM/Rate is based on heat balance equations modified by correlations. It is not a true simulation, and has difficulty dealing with dynamic heat or mass transfer phenomena that take place in short time increments. It will be less flexible to handle future technology than the true simulation programs.

1.  **EnergyGauge® USA Version 2.6**
    Energy Gauge

> EnergyGauge is based on DOE 2 which is based on a transfer function and weighting factor mathematical approach to solving the heat transfer equations. DOE-2 is no longer supported by the USDOE. It is difficult to modify. EnergyGauge has used the "External Function" capability of DOE-2 to add some features, but the kinds of features that can be added that way is fairly limited.

1.  **TREAT**

> Performance Systems Development, Inc.
>
> 124 Brindley Street,
>
> TREAT is based on SUNREL which is based on a numerical (forward finite differencing) approach. SUNREL has limited mechanical systems, but is relatively easy to add new features to. It does a very good job calculating building loads. TREAT provides a user friendly interface. SUNREL has a clearly written Users Manual. The program can be obtained or licensed as TREAT (with the interface) or as SUNREL alone with a less elaborate user interface. Changes to the SUNREL internal code have to be arranged through NREL.

Both REM/Rate and EnergyGauge are certified for use in HERS programs and for use in applying for federal tax credits. TREAT is not currently certified but its developers believe that they will be able to meet those requirements in the near future. Also, the underlying simulation software in EnergyGauge (DOE-2), TREAT (SUNREL), and -3000 () have all been tested with the NREL/IEA BESTEST method and have all come out well in those tests. REM- is a correlation method, not a real simulation program and has done well in the NREL/HERS-BESTEST tests, but cannot perform the NREL/IEA BESTEST or ASHRAE Standard 140 tests (based on NREL/IEA BESTEST).

Several other programs were also considered and rejected for this study for various reasons:

1.  **HOT3000**: Hot3000 is a product of the CANMET Energy Technology Centre (part of the Canadian government Natural Resources department). This will be the followup to the well-known HOT2000 program that some Alaskans used many years ago. It is being developed for the Canadian residential market and their models could be more closely compared to Alaskan building construction. However, HOT3000 is not certified for HERS, IECC, Energy Star, or tax credits. It is only in beta version at this time and test runs frequently crashed.

2.  ***EnergyPlus***: EnergyPlus can be used directly as well as a calculation engine for other user interfaces. It was not included in our review because it is a more complex program than necessary for our needs. For a typical home file there may be over 2000 inputs required. Compared to the 100-200 inputs most of the other applications require, this application is exceptionally cumbersome. To give an example of the detail level, the inputs include the need to geometrically determine and input every vertex of the walls, doors, and windows. The outputs of EnergyPlus are also complex and do not include HERS, Energy Star, tax credit, or IECC results.

3.  **BUILDER ENERGY SOLUTIONS CALCULATOR:** This is a package produced by Owens Corning has also been approved as a software tool to serve the interests of the builder looking to take advantage of the $2000 tax credit for each certified home. While this program could help us with access to the tax credits it would not be as useful for other programs such as energy ratings or weatherization.

Our initial intention was to develop several building models that represented Alaskan residential buildings and that we could use for comparison of the 3 software packages and AKWarm. We came up with 4 models: single family building on crawlspace, basement, zero-lot line, and multifamily building that could be moved to different locations in the state.

After a short introductory walk through of each program, we attempted, alone and together, to input the building information into each program. From the very beginning we realized how difficult this would be. There is a great difference among programs in terms of building inputs and some of those differences can affect outputs.

All researchers and developers we talked to agreed that it can be very challenging to develop models that are the same in various software tools.  Developers for RemRate and EnergyGauge who know the intricacies of their own programs, have attempted this many times over the years and told us: “Even for us it is challenging to build models that are truly comparable, and it often takes numerous iterations before we end up with comparable models.” Another study of Energy Star homes in the concluded that:

> *“the researchers determined that the modeling softwares each assess the energy impact of ventilation in different ways. Further research is needed to determine the extent of these variations, and how they may have an impact on results generated by these softwares, including qualification for tax credits.” *

The Residential Energy Services Network's (RESNET) website lists 78 organizations that that have been accredited through the Mortgage Industry National Home Energy Rating System Accreditation Standard. The systems have been reviewed by either the state energy office or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and accredited by the Mortgage Industry Accreditation Review Committee.

Accredited rating providers have the responsibility of ensuring the quality of rating services. Rating providers are responsible for administering rating programs. These responsibilities include:

-   Certification of raters

-   Selection of accredited rating software programs

-   Rating quality assurance

-   Marketing of rating services

We contacted all of these organizations that appeared to be involved in programs similar to the rating program provided by AHFC. We asked them to answer a few questions:

 

1. What software program you use

2. How you use it for your particular programs, and

3. How or if you would change it?

The responses we received were almost all from REM/Rate users. While there are always improvements people would like to see, responders invariably gave REM/Rate high marks for user friendliness and especially for customer support. NO complained about the service they received, which is significant, since REM/ requires ongoing financial costs both to provider and rater.

The consensus was that the program was useful for ratings but that it shouldn’t be considered a load calc program. Internal calculations seem to favor larger homes being able to meet Energy Star levels better than smaller homes. This, however, may be appropriate. Larger homes are inherently more efficient on a BTU/SF basis than smaller homes due to their smaller surface to volume ratio.

NOTE: TREAT and 2000/3000 are not RESNET-certified rating programs so the list of certified providers does would not include those who use their programs. There are some users of EnergyGauge on the list but we received no responses from them.

There were interesting comments about deciding how much we want to be involved in software development as opposed to letting the developers keep up with that and working more on program development and field work to help builders improve their product. Oregon Energy Office also believed that prescriptive energy codes were much more successful than performance based codes that rely on software outputs. The individual responses are provided in the appendix.

It was beyond the scope of this short study to spend additional time on attempting to consistently model the buildings across all software platforms. Since all of them have been independently tested and certified to meet rating and tax program requirements nationwide, we accepted that we were not in a position to second guess the experts.

We then decided to examine each program on its own merits and our “feel” for how well it would meet the needs of our programs and users. Appendix B provides more detailed comments.

Both REM/Rate and EnergyGauge are certified for use in HERS programs and for use in applying for federal tax credits. TREAT is not currently certified but its developers believe that they will be able to meet those requirements in the near future.

1.  **Options and Costs**

Before delving into the options for the future of AHFC’s Home Energy Rating Program the authors feel it is necessary to restate two critical facts:

1.  AKWarm, as it is currently used, does not show compliance with the Building Energy Efficiency Standard as it was modified effective . This is a serious problem because homes started after that date are being completed and are in need of a compliance method. Also, plans are now being reviewed for future homes and the official “tool” for this review is not in compliance. *The AKWarm reference home needs to be updated immediately.*

2.  As far as the tax credits go, it does not matter what AHFC does with respect to its software choice. Unless the raters themselves are certified by either RESNET or “an equivalent rating network” builders in will not have access to the tax credits anyway. *AHFC needs to take whatever steps are necessary to either become certified through RESNET or to become recognized as an “equivalent rating network”.*

In the following paragraphs we present potential courses of action, note whether they are long-term or short-term solutions, estimate their production times, and provide rough cost estimates. It should be noted that in most cases there will need to be extensive training for the rater network over and above the times and costs shown in this report. The cost estimates also do not include administrative costs should the development or services be funneled through a third party such as CCHRC or ABSN.

> **
> Option A: Create an external tax credit analysis routine for AKWarm**
>
> It is possible to use the information contained in the AKWarm file and produce new reports with some additional calculations that build on the AKWarm calculation.  An Energy Tax Credit report in this fashion, but the algorithm for compliance would *not* involve simulating an IECC reference house and then comparing it to the AKWarm house.  Compliance would have to be done via a simple algorithm like comparing the Rating Points total to a compliance rating point threshold (e.g. compliance for a single story on crawl house in Anchorage requires a rating point total of 86 or higher).

-   Short term solution

-   Local development and support

> *Cons*:

-   Would still need to be approved by RESNET (or an equivalent……)

-   Does not address any of the long-term issues

> *Cost*: about $15,000
>
> *Timeframe*: 3 months
>
> *Comment*: Probably not worthwhile unless we can be assured of approval

**Option B: Major Rewrite of AkWarm For Long-Term Needs**

> When AKWarm was originally developed, it used a number of third party add-ons to the Visual Basic 3.0 programming language. Most of those add-ons are no longer available, no longer supported, and no longer needed. To become current with existing needs and provide for the future a number of major changes would be necessary including:

-   Rewrite software into VB.Net. This requires incorporating previous add-ons directly into the new version, making other necessary software changes, and recompiling the entire package. This step basically gives us AKWarm as we have it now without any improvements other than being able to run on Windows Vista. It is, however, necessary before any other improvements can be implemented. At this stage we might even consider using one of the simulation engines instead of a correlation method.

-   Make the needed and desired improvements to the VB.Net version of AKWarm:

    -   Review of Assumptions

    -   Improved reporting capabilities

    -   New library format and access regulation

    -   Improvement Options enhancement

    -   Lighting and Appliance module

    -   Alternative Energy module

    -   BEES certification

    -   Tax credit certification

    -   Ventilation certification

    -   Fuel switching options

    -   certification

> *Pros*:

-   Can continue to be free to full range of users

-   Local development and maintenance

-   More control over getting just what we want (AKWarm has some input flexibilities not available in the other programs such as multiple insulation levels in a single building element).

-   Minimal training for users

-   Already proven and accepted by state agencies

-   Would allow future flexibility

> *Cons*:

-   Would still need to be approved by RESNET (or an equivalent……)

-   Would require a level of future support not presently available from AHFC

-   There is only one developer familiar enough with AKWarm to trust with the new software development

> *Cost*: about $50,000 to convert to VB.Net. Probably another $50,000 - $75,000 to make other improvements.
>
> *Timeframe*: 1 year
>
> *Comment*: An exciting prospect but with high cost (although not high relative to AHFC’s previously unsuccessful efforts) and long time frame.
>
> **Option C. Adoption of nationally-approved software package**
>
> The adoption of a nationally approved software package as the basis for showing compliance with the state’s energy standard, as well as being certified for HERS and federal tax credit compliance, has large potential benefits for . While having a unique state program has the benefit of maintaining state control and provides for innovation, it also carries large costs since all supporting documents, training information, and technical interpretations have to be created and paid for entirely by the state. Adopting a similar (national) program spreads these administrative costs across many states, users. Also, adopting a national program is not restrictive since the basic structure can be adopted and then amended as necessary to achieve state-specific goals. Also, outputs from several of these programs can be sent to common programs like Microsoft Word or Excel. Again, the major contenders for this option are:

> **REM/Rate**
>
> *Pros*:

-   Excellent support from developer

-   Already approved for Tax Credit certification

-   Used by the majority of energy raters nationally

-   Can be modified for our 2006 IECC reference quickly and cheaply

-   Two layers of input detail.

-   Editable materials libraries

> *Cons*:

-   May be weather file issues

-   Uses the new Zero points – Zero Energy Use scale

-   Greater initial training requirement.

> *Cost*: See chart
>
> *Timeframe*: 3 months
>
> *Comment*: Clearly the winner among all the responding energy raters/providers
>
> **TREAT 4.0 (available Spring 2008)**
>
> *Pros*:

-   Excellent support from developer

-   Allows user developed report formats

-   Will allow building of weather and material libraries

-   We can create our own reference house sets

-   Will be able to do either indexed or non-indexed point/star ratings

> *Cons*:

-   Not yet approved for tax credit certification by RESNET

-   Greater initial training requirement.

-   Not used for ratings in the past – only weatherization

> *Cost*: See chart
>
> *Timeframe*: 9 months until release.
>
> *Comment*: Need to reserve judgment until 4.0 is available.

> **Energy Gauge **
>
> *Pros*:

-   Already approved for Tax Credit certification

-   Can probably be modified for our 2006 IECC reference quickly and cheaply

-   Broad report spectrum

-   

> *Cons*:

-   Spotty technical support. Questions to the FSEC Executive Director were answered quickly. An e-mail technical support request via their website (their official method) was never answered.

-   Uses the new Zero points – Zero Energy Use scale

-   Greater initial training requirement.

-   Improvement Analysis feature not yet operational

-   Most limited of the three packages from the input flexibility point of view

-   No library view, access, or ability to change

> *Cost*: See chart
>
> *Timeframe*: 3 months
>
> *Comment*: Clearly the winner among all the responding energy raters/providers
>
> **Option D. Multiple platforms**
>
> It is conceivable that the best option for ’s situation would be to continue with AKWarm as it exists (with the reference-home library change). RESNET approved programs could be used for situations that require it, such as the federal tax credit program or Energy Star certification.
>
> *Pros*:

-   Only need minor changes to AKWarm which would still be used for AHFC Energy Ratings

-   AKWarm would still be available for free to the public

-   AHFC would not need to train raters to use other software packages

> *Cons*:

-   AKWarm quick fix only last as long as Windows XP is predominant

-   Raters still must be certified by RESNET or the equivalent rating network

> *Cost*: None to AHFC except library update. Cost to raters would depend on the software they chose to use. AHFC would have no control over that.
>
> *Timeframe*: Depends on how active AHFC is in getting raters approved.
>
> *Comment*: Probably the least cost, fastest way to resolve immediate issues while we continue to contemplate a longer term solution.

**RESNET Costs**

In addition to the costs incurred by obtaining, modifying, supporting, and using the above software packages, there are also costs involved with RESNET certification should AHFC choose to take that path. These include application costs, annual accreditation fees, and rating registration fees. The following is the accreditation fee structure for HERS Providers. The annual fee for accreditation of rating software, and rater training providers is $1750, with a $250 annual discount for entities who are accredited in two categories and a $500 annual discount for entities who are accredited in three categories.

|-----------------------------------------|
| **2005 ENERGY Homes Accreditation Fee** |
| 0 - 500                                 |
| 501 - 1,500                             |
| 1,501 - 4,000                           |
| 4,001 - 7,500                           |
| 7,501 - up                              |

The annual RESNET cost to AHFC if AKWarm was approved as a rating software package would be over $5,500 if we did about 1,000 ratings per year. If we used another accredited program the cost would be $1,750 less.

**Envelope Leakage and Infiltration Conversions** Used by EnergyGauge® v.2.5 Compiled by P. Fairey

There are a large number of descriptors and variables used in the determination and representation of envelope leakage and infiltration in residential buildings. It is possible to convert back and forth between these variables and descriptors. The following discussion provides the necessary conventions for such conversions as they are used in EnergyGauge .

General Nomenclature:

ELA = effective leakage area (in^2) [US: E 779-92] (see Note 1)

CFA = conditioned floor area (in^2)

= specific leakage area (in^2/in^2) = ELA / CFA

C = leakage coefficient (result of least squares regression of test data) (see Note 2)

n = flow exponent (result of least squares regression of test data)

ÄP = pressure differential (Pa)

EqLA = equivalent leakage area (in^2) [Canadian: CAN/SGSB-149.10-M86] (see Note 3)

ach = annual average air change rate (conditioned space volume changes per hour)

ach50 = air changes per hour at 50 Pa pressure differential

cfm50 = airflow through leakage area at 50 Pa pressure differential

cfm25 = airflow through leakage area at 25 Pa pressure differential

= conditioned space volume (ft^3)

W = weather factor (from ASHRAE Standard 136)

NS = number of stories above grade

nL = normalized leakage (from ASHRAE Standard 119)

ASTM Standard E 779-92 Source Equations (SI Units):

Q = C \* ÄP^n [equation used to regress test data]

L = C \* (ÄPr)^(n-½) \* (ñ/2)^½

where:

Q = airflow (m^3/s)

L = leakage area (m^2)

ÄPr = reference pressure differential (Pa) [taken as 4 Pa]

ñ = air density (kg/m^3) [taken as 1.20 kg/m^3]

Conversion Equations (IP units):

nL = 1000 \* \* NS^0.3 [ASHRAE Standard 119] (1)

= nL / (1000 \* NS^0.3) (2)

= ELA / CFA (3)

ELA = CFA \* (4)

= ach / (1000 \* W \* NS^0.3) (5)

ach = \* 1000 \* W \* NS^0.3 (6)

ELA = 0.2835 \* C \* 4^n [‘C’ input in IP units] (see Note 4) (7)

EqLA = 0.2939 \* C \* 10^n [‘C’ input in IP units] (8)

C = ELA / (0.2835 \* 4^n) [‘C’ returned in IP units] (9)

C = EqLA / (0.2939 \* 10^n) [‘C’ returned in IP units] (10)

cfm50 = C \* 50^n [‘C’ input in IP units] (11)

cfm25 = C \* 25^n [‘C’ input in IP units] (12)

ach50 = (cfm50 \* 60) / (13)

cfm50 = \* ach50 / 60 (14)

**Conditioned Basement Leakage – A Special Case**

Some standards require that the basement zone leakage in Reference Homes with conditioned basement be related to the percentage of the conditioned basement exterior gross wall area that is above grade in accordance with the following formula:

SLAbsmt = SLAmain \* [(BWAa-g) / (BWAtot)] Eq. 1

Such standards also provide that the overall leakage for homes with conditioned basements be calculated based on the respective conditioned zone areas, as follows:

SLAOA = [(CFAbsmt \* SLAbsmt) + (CFAmain \* SLAmain)] / [CFAtot] Eq. 2

where:

= gross exterior basement wall area

CFA = conditioned floor area

and where the subscripts represent:

bsmt = basement zone of the home

main = above-grade zone(s) of the home

a-g = above-grade value

tot = total value

OA = overall value including all zones of the home

For HERS Reference Homes with conditioned basements, the 1999 HERS standard specifies that the Reference Home have a normalized leakage (nL) of 0.57. Using conversion equation (2) to convert nL to yields:

SLAOA = nLOA / (1000 \* NS^0.3)

For Rated Homes with “proposed” or “tested” leakage, the test protocols require that the measured leakage values represent the entire conditioned space, including the conditioned basement zone. The main zone leakage may be calculated individually by substituting the right hand side of equation 1 into equation 2 to obtain SLAmain, as follows:

SLAmain = [CFAtot\* SLAOA] / [CFAbsmt\*(BWAa-g / BWAtot) + CFAmain] Eq. 3

SLAbsmt may then be calculated by solving Equation 1 in its original form.

Derivation of the Coefficient Used in Conversion Equation (7)

Beginning with the SI source equations and converting from SI units to IP units:

Q = C \* ÄP^n Eq. 4

L = C \* (ÄPr)^(n-½) \* (ñ/2)^½ Eq. 5

To convert from SI units to IP units, both L and C must be converted. The units of L are converted from m^2 to in^2, as follows.

CFL = m^2 \* 10.764 ft^2/m^2 \* 144 in^2/ft^2 = 1550 in^2 per m^2

From equation 4 the units of C are m^3/s / Pa^n and the Pa^n term cancels in equation 5, leaving the m^3/s term to be converted to ft^3/min (cfm), as follows:

CFC = m^3/s \* 35.31ft^3/m^3 \* 60 s/min = 2118.6 ft^3/min per m^3/s

To convert L from m^2 to its ELA equivalent (in^2), the right hand side of equation 5 is multiplied by CFL and to convert C from m^3/s to ft^3/min (cfm), the right hand side of equation 5 is divided by CFC, such that the overall units conversion factor is:

CFSI-IP = 1550 / 2118.6 = 0.7316

Applying CFSI-IP to the right hand side of equation 5 yields ELA, as follows:

ELA = 0.7316\*C \* (ÄPr)^(n-½) \* (ñ/2)^½ Eq. 6

Simplifying the individual terms of equation 6 yields:

(ÄPr)^(n-½) = (4^n / 4^½) = 4^n/2 [standard reference pressure = 4 Pa]

(ñ/2)^½ = (1.20/2)^½ = 0.7746 [assumed air density = 1.20 kg/m^3]

And recombining the simplified terms into equation 6 yields:

ELA = 0.7316 \* C \* 4^n/2 \* 0.7746

ELA = 0.2833 \* C \* 4^n Eq. 7

Note that the conversion factor (0.2833) in equation 7 is virtually identical to the conversion factor of 0.2835 given by the referenced Energy Conservancy document (see Note 4).

Notes:

1 The standard reference pressure differential for the calculation of ELA is 4 Pa (U.S. Standard).

2 The units of measured data used in the least squares regression determine the units and value of ‘C’. For SI units, ‘C’ will be derived from airflows measured in m^3/s and for IP units, ‘C’ will be derived from airflows measured in ft^3/min (cfm). As a result, the value and units of ‘C’ will differ substantially based on whether the regression is performed using IP units or SI units. The units of pressure in both systems are

3 The standard reference pressure differential for the calculation of EqLA is 10 Pa (Canadian Standard).

***Mechanical Ventilation Calculations***

The discussion below shows the EnergyGauge USA calculation procedure for 2006 ratings to meet the interpreted rules of RESNET's method for mechanical ventilation. These changes can be seen by viewing the Infiltration component screen of the 2006 Rated House.

If there is mechanical ventilation:

1. Calculate mincfm based on number of bedrooms and conditioned floor area:

(0.01 \* CFArea) + (7.5 \* (Bedrooms+ 1)).

2. Calculate amount of expected natural infiltration as

Expected Natural Infiltration = 0.02\*CFA.

3. Calculate Excessive(+) or Shortage(-) from Expected

Excessive = Entered Natural Infiltration - Expected Natural Infiltration.

4. Adjust the mechanical mincfm by one half of the excessive natural amount

Mincfm = Mincfm - 0.5\*Excessive.

5. Compute entered mechanical cfm for testing:

a. For Fans/ERV with runtime set, the larger of the exhaust or supply entered flow is adjusted by the runtime percent entered

b. For runtime vent with min and max, the entered flow is adjusted by the larger of the min runtime entered or 20%; if max runtime is set lower than 20% it is only adjusted up to the max amount entered

c. For simple runtime vent, no adjustment - the entered ventilation system will be modified (see later step).

6. If the mechanical system flow is less than the mincfm required then the following rules are invoked:

a. For Fans/ERV, use the entered runtime but adjust the flow to cfmmin for the larger of exhaust or supply - note that this means a balanced system will be unbalanced but more energy efficient for supplying a certain volume of air. Thus if a mincfm of 50 is required but the user indicated 60 cfm running just 33% of the time, now there will be a 150 cfm fan running 33% of the time. The power/(exhaust+supply cfm) ratio of the entered system will be applied to the new flow rate to determine the power draw for the ERV.

b. For runtime vent with min and max, if the min or max is less than 20% then set both to 20% and adjust the continuous mincfm to be five times larger (thus for 50 cfm continuous the software will compute 250 cfm). If larger min vent is entered then the flow will be computed on that rate. For example, 33% minvent will yield 150 cfm for this example.

c. For runtime vent (no min or max control), the rated home will be changed to a "runtime vent with min" and minvent and maxvent set to 20% and five times the required continuous flow. In the example, this would result in 250 cfm.

When there is no mechanical ventilation the natural infiltration is adjusted to the higher of the entered value or 0.35 ach for the rated home.

The reference house is modeled with a default natural infiltration all the time. If there is a mechanical ventilation system in the user home then extra fan energy is added to the reference home per RESNET rules.

***Hardware Requirements***

OS: Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows

CPU: 200 MHz or better

: 64 MB or better

Disk: 20 MB or better free disk space

Other: for software installation

Help: REM help is a compiled HTML file and requires Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher. It can be run as a stand alone program by double-clicking on the file "REM\_Help.chm", located in the same directory as the REM executable.

***Operating Modes***

REM now operates in three different modes: *Trial*, *Provider* and *Rater*. *Trial* is for evaluation and training. Which mode the program runs is determined when the program is registered. *Provider* is designed for use only by accredited HERS Providers. *Rater* mode is for the individual Raters working in the HERS program administered by a Provider. The *Rater* level has the printing capability that the Provider grants it. The operation mode only affects what reports can be printed; all other functions operate in the same manner.

***Files***

-   REMRate projects are created and stored in individual (bdg) data files..

-   Files may also be exported to a new or existing database file (MS ACCESS 2000)

***Libraries***

**Building Component Libraries**

These libraries contain descriptions of building components which may be common to many buildings. These component library types can be accessed in the Detailed Inputs or Simplified Inputs screens:

**Foundation Wall** specified by construction type, interior and exterior insulation.

**Slab Floor** specified by perimeter insulation and under slab insulation.

**Frame Floor** described by path area and layers or continuous and frame cavity insulation.

**Above-Grade Wall** described by path area and layers or continuous and frame cavity insulation.

**Window/Skylight** specified by U-value and Solar heat Gain Coefficients.

**Door** described by R-value and storm door presence.

**Ceiling** described by path area and layers or continuous and frame cavity insulation.

**Heating Equipment** described by type, capacity and efficiency.

**Cooling Equipment** described by type, capacity and efficiency.

**Water Heating Equipment** described by type, capacity and efficiency.

**Air-Source Heat Pump** described by type, capacity and efficiency.

**Ground-Source Heat Pump** - closed loop systems described by capacity and efficiencies.

**Dual Fuel Heat Pumps** described by fuel type, heating and cooling capacity, and back-up

heating type, and efficiency.

**Integrated Space/Water Heating** - described by type, capacity and efficiency.

**Improvement Analysis Libraries**

These libraries are used when performing an energy efficient improvement analysis.

**Improvement Measures** - This library contains energy efficient improvement measures that are automatically evaluated each time an ***Improvement Analysis*** is requested. Any measures with a preexisting condition found in the building will be evaluated.

**Improvement Measures Costs** - This library contains measure costs associated with the energy efficient improvement measures of an improvement analysis.

**Utility Rates Library**

This library contains a description of utility rates. You can create or modify rates based on a set of monthly blocks for different utilities and/or different fuel types.

**Library Utilities**

**Library Set**: In previous versions of REM, all libraries were stored in the application folder.

Now, libraries can be stored in any number of folders, and REM lets you switch from one folder to

another. A folder containing library files is called a *library set.*

**Library Transfer** lets you transfer library entries to and from transfer files. These files (\*.LBT files) may then be copied to a floppy disk, and then onto another machine, where a second copy of REM will be able to load the saved libraries. This allows libraries to be easily shared by different users, and even allows organizations to create and maintain a "master library" that can be easily distributed. The library transfer menu can develop new library transfer menus or create new ones. REM/*Rate* has added two library transfer files, one for **Manual J** components, and one for HVAC equipment.

**Code Compliance**

REM/*Rate* helps you quickly determine if the building you are analyzing meets the 1992, 1993 or 1995 CABO Model Energy Code (MEC), ASHRAE Standard 90.2 - 1993, or any of the IECC Compliances (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, Energy Conservation Code of New York State, and the Energy Conservation Code of Southern Nevada).

The MEC Uo compliance report compares the overall U-value of the building described in REM/*Rate* to the overall U-value for an identical home insulated to meet the minimum component performance requirements of the MEC. This type of compliance, using an overall U-value, accounts for tradeoffs between different components of the home. The report for MEC Uo compliance lists the U-values for each building component as defined in the MEC for both the code building and the building as designed (R-values are listed for slab floors). In the case where a frame floor is situated over a crawl space or

unconditioned basement, the MEC requires either the floor or the foundation walls to be insulated. Of these two areas, REM/*Rate* will use the component most heavily insulated to check MEC compliance.

The ASHRAE Standard 90.2 - 1993 Uo compliance report is slightly different than that for MEC. For each component in the building a *load change* is calculated. The load change is calculated from the difference in U-values for the design building and the standards building, the heating and cooling degree-days for the site, and weighting factors correcting for the relative importance of each component. The sum of the load changes for all components must be positive for the building to comply with the ASHRAE standard.

The ASHRAE and MEC performance compliance reports compare the annual energy use for heating and cooling for the building to the energy use for the same building built to meet the minimum prescriptive code requirements. Some aspects of the building are changed to meet the requirements for performing this type of compliance analysis so the energy values reported may differ from those in other REM/*Rate* reports. What is important is how the energy use compares for the two buildings in this report. If the building in REM/*Rate* uses less energy than the building built to code, the building is in compliance. This type of compliance analysis is well suited for buildings with passive solar features or high efficiency

equipment.

**User Defined Reference Home**

Use this feature to create and customize reference homes. A reference home could describe a local code, or local building practices. Once defined, a **UDRH can be selected** to compare the energy use of any building to that of the reference building.

**Custom Features**

**Batch Mode**

This feature allows you to create a list of buildings (batch) to run all at one time. Once the list of buildings has

been determined, you can select reports to view, and/or export the buildings. The Batch Mode is also instrumental in comparing energy savings due to energy saving measures. For example, use different types of heating equipment for each home to observe which saves the most energy. Another example might include duplicating a home: Use one as the baseline home to be left unchanged, and the other as the dynamic home. Add an energy saving feature to the dynamic home and note the change. Continue this trend to observe the incremental energy and energy cost savings.

**Lights and Appliances**

Version 12 of REM requires a **lights and appliances audit**. There are two options to completing this screen, simplified which takes defaults of equipment or detailed which allows you to add equipment information which is taken into account when generating an energy rating.

***Orientation – Windows/Wall Input***

In REM you find the house orientation in the window screen and exterior walls are assigned to each window, indirectly assigning a wall to an orientation. REM window functionality includes the input of overhangs based upon measurements

instead of subjective measurements. REM requires you to input the depth from top of window, and from bottom of window, into the overhang fields.

.

**Default Values**

Default Values inputs allow the user to speed up the data entry for the energy model. The default value applies only to the components that are created after the default is set. For example, changing the default wall constructions will not affect walls that are already entered in the project, but each new wall created after the default was set would have the new default construction.

**Reports**

Some reports are available in a two-building format where one building is compared to a reference building and display the differences in energy use and cost. Each of the menu options are discussed below.

**Quick Analysis** - This subcommand performs an energy calculation based on the selected building file and location, and presents a one-page output of results for a quick overview of energy performance.

**HOME ENERGY RATING**

REM/*Rate* provides a HERS Index and an annual energy cost in accordance with the RESNET HERS Standards. The energy efficiency rating of a house is presented as an Index. The Index is based on a comparison of the annual energy requirements for heating, cooling and hot water in the home being rated (with some standard operating conditions), to the annual energy requirements for the same home reconfigured to RESNET HERS *Reference Home*. The Reference Home is assigned an Index of 100 points. A Rated Home with the same annual energy requirements as its associated Reference Home would have a HERS Index of 100. Every one percent decrease in the Rated Home's energy requirements from the References Home's energy requirements decreases the Rated Home's Index by one point. Similarly, an increase of one percent in the ratio

increases the Rated Home's Index by one point. The RESNET HERS Standards also specifies a star rating*.*

***Weather Data***

If the exact location you are interested in is not listed, select a nearby location with similar weather characteristics.

The heating degree-days () and cooling degree-hours (***CDH***) shown on the location selection dialog are used for code compliance purposes only; MEC uses while ASHRAE 90.2 requires both and CDH. Default values are displayed when a weather location is selected. If you need to show compliance for a specific (as is often required by local energy codes), edit the existing value as needed.

Also displayed on the location selection dialog are:

**Climate Zone**

***ASHRAE W Factor***

***Design Heating Temperature – based on 2005 Handbook of Fundamentals, Design Heating Temperature***

***Design Cooling Temperature – based on 2005 Handbook of Fundamentals, Design Cooling Temperature***

***Spreadsheet***

REM has a simple spreadsheet in which you can enter numbers, text, and formulas, much like EXCEL. The spreadsheet is visible on the screen at any time. It is part of the building, and is saved and loaded in the building file.

***Utility Bills***

Use this dialog to enter the actual utility bills for the current building. The data are used in generating the Utility Bill Reconciliation report, which compares the annual billing data to the energy use predicted by REM. The data is associated with the building and saved in the building file.

***Manual J***

Manual J is a load calculation methodology developed jointly by the Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) and the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (). Manual J provides accurate, practical procedures and data for calculating heat loss and heat gain in residential buildings. This data is taken from the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals. Manual J uses a library of envelope components and assigns each one a Heat Transfer Multiplier (HTM) based on construction, the design temperature difference, and season. REM/*Rate* includes the entire Manual J library as a **Library Transfer File**.

***Improvement Measures***

REM/*Rate* lets you define improvement measures for a building. Improvement measures are defined by an *Existing* Condition (actual or designed), a *Proposed* Condition, and **Measures Costs**. When an **Improvement Analysis** is performed, improvement measures whose *existing* condition match the current components in the building are evaluated, ranked, and reported in the improvement analysis report.

The following **library-based measures** can be accessed in REM :

> *Ceiling*
>
> *Above Grade Wall*
>
> *Foundation Wall*
>
> *Frame Floor*
>
> *Slab Floor*
>
> *Window*
>
> *Skylight*
>
> *Door*
>
> *Mechanical Equipment - Heating, Cooling, DHW*

***Library Set***

A *library set* is a complete set of REM libraries stored in a folder. During the REM install, a default library

set is initially created and saved in the "Libraries" subfolder in the application path. REM can recognize

library files stored anywhere in the file system accessible by your computer. A library set can be locked and password-protected. Individual items in a library can be locked; locked items can't be modified by you unless you enter a password. Or, the entire library set can be locked preventing changes to the set as a whole.

***Print Permissions Dialog (Provider Only)***

REM*/Rate* gives the Provider a simple, yet flexible way to manage the print permissions for Raters. **The**

**print permissions dialog box is only for use by Providers.** From this dialog, a Provider can view/send permissions to the web site, create permissions to e-mail to a Rater, and set the permission for a building file.

**TREAT & SUNREL Calculations**

TREAT employs the SUNREL computer program developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab for load calculations. TREAT supplements SUNREL’s load calculations with three types of calculations:

1.  Calculations before running SUNREL, such as lights and appliances, the results of which are passed to SUNREL to use for its internal gains.

2.  Calculations after running SUNREL, such as equipment energy consumption calculations to meet loads calculated by SUNREL and fuel cost calculations.

3.  Calculations which are independent of SUNREL, such as billing calculations.

TREAT also gathers all input from the user, stores the input, and process the output into reports

SUNREL was developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)by Ron Judkoff, Paul Torcellini, and Mike Deru. SUNREL ™ is a trademark of Midwest Research Institute. Copyright © 2000 Midwest Research Institute. All rights reserved. NREL is a national laboratory owned by the U.S. Department of Energy and managed by Midwest Research Institute, Battelle Memorial Institute and Bechtel National, Inc.

The SUNREL calculation engine was selected for the following reasons:

-   well tested through experimentation, practical use, comparison to other software

-   used as benchmark for the International Energy Association testing procedure known as BESTEST.

-   hourly model

-   uses weather data from TM2 files

-   determines loads that HVAC system will encounter (except for mechanical ventilation) due to losses through surfaces/windows, infiltration solar gains, interaction with internal heat gains, etc.).

HVAC calculations

-   Additional load due to mechanical ventilation

-   appliances, lighting, domestic hot water.

-   system efficiency, distribution losses

-   calculate annual heating/cooling energy usage

-   monthly model, relies on statistical distribution of temperature during each month and monthly outputs of energy calculations.

At this time, TREAT is the sole commercial application of the SUNREL calculation engine.

**Energy Model Description (From TREAT 3.0.1.9 User Manual 2005)**

-   A building is viewed as an aggregation of spaces (rooms). Spaces may be conditioned (heated and/or cooled) or unconditioned. The maximum number of spaces in a building is 100.

-   Each space must have at least one surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). Only exterior surfaces and surfaces between heated and unheated spaces may be entered. The total number of surfaces in a project must not exceed 500. Up to 300 of them may be exterior surfaces (including exterior doors). There may be up to 100 unique wall constructions.

-   Each space may contain unlimited number of appliances and lighting and a ventilation fan.

-   Each exterior surface may contain multiple doors and windows. The total number of window records in the building must not exceed 500. A single window record may be used to describe multiple windows on the same wall by entering window quantity.

-   Each wall may have a single overhang, to model shading. The overhang runs the full length of the wall, is located at the top of the wall and is a horizontal surface parallel to the ground.

-   The model building must have a heating system that may consist of up to two subsystems: main (primary) and backup (secondary). Each subsystem has its own distribution system. Back up heating is activated when the main heating capacity is exceeded.

-   The heating system can be connected to multiple thermostats (the building can have multiple heating zones).

-   Each heating/cooling zone may include any number of spaces (rooms).

-   The building may have a cooling system. The cooling system may share its distribution with a heating subsystem.

-   Heating and cooling systems share thermostats.

-   Each conditioned space must belong to one heating/cooling zone (controlled by one thermostat).

-   The leakage area of a heated space is distributed among its surfaces in proportion to the surface area.

-   If, in addition, the user assigns leakage area to surfaces, then only the remaining (unassigned) leakage is distributed among surfaces in proportion to the surface area.

-   Each project may contain a model of a single and unlimited number of improvement packages for that .

**Hardware Requirements**

-   CPU: Pentium II - 300 MHz (1.5 GHz recommended)

-   : 128 MB (512 MB recommended)

-   Disk space: the total required hard drive space is 550MB (1 GB recommended), with at least 500 MB (1 GB recommended) on C-drive

-   Screen resolution: 800x600 pixels minimum

-   Color palette: 24 bit (recommended)

-   Other devices: Printer, paper size: "Letter" format (required)

-   MS compatible mouse (two button)

-   Operating systems: Windows 98 Second Edition / ME / NT4.0 service pack 6 / 2000 / XP

**Files**

-   TREAT projects are created and stored in Treat Project Group (TPG) data files. Each TPG may contain one or more projects created by the user. Each TPG is stored in a single file with a TPG extension.

<!-- -->

-   Support for multiple Project Groups: each project group represents a single TREAT database.

-   Archiving and data-compression: a TPG file is a compressed TREAT database. It reduces the disk space needed to store the TREAT database by 50% -90%.

-   Portability: a single-file appearance facilitates project exchange between TREAT users. The TPG files are small enough to easily email or store on a standard diskette.

-   Facilitating library updates: To allow backward compatibility between versions, TREAT may automatically update libraries in databases created with an older version.

-   Quick access from the TREAT menu to up to eight most recently used TPG files.

-   Links to TREAT website may be used to check for the latest TREAT update patches, library updates and general information on TREAT.

-   Limitations:

> - Individual TREAT projects cannot not be moved between project groups (TPG files).
>
> - Using shortcuts to TPG files instead of the TPG files themselves is not supported and may cause loss of data and errors if used.
>
> - Opening or saving of TPG files on a network drive or server is not supported and may cause loss of data and errors if used.

**Libraries**

**Editable Libraries**

TREAT has the following editable libraries: User, Customer, Contractor, Daily Weather Data and Fuel

Rate. They can be accessed from the Main Menu by selecting Library and then the name of the library. There are

shortcuts to the libraries from input screens where the library data is used. Any changes to User, Customer, Contractor and Daily Weather Data libraries affect both future and existing projects. Changes made to the Fuel Rate Library affect future projects only.

**Non-editable Libraries**

TREAT has non-editable libraries including the Fuel Library, Surface Library, Door Library, Glazing Library, Window Frame Library, Lighting Library, Appliance Library, Heating Library, Cooling Library and Domestic Hot Water Library. These libraries can be accessed from the input panel screens only when a corresponding component is being input or edited.

The library entries for Lighting, Appliances, Heating, Cooling, and Domestic Hot Water can be edited for the current project once the entry has been selected and is shown in the input line of the appropriate Building Model screen. The libraries for Windows, Walls and Doors can not be edited for the current building. The databases for these libraries contain additional information beyond the information shown. Energy Star compliance in the libraries reflects the standard requirements in effect as of the version release date.

The depository can store only one copy of each library for future copying to other projects. The Store Editable Libraries option is enabled when a TPG is opened. No changes are made to the libraries in the open project when the Store Editable Libraries option is used. If an editable library, for example Customer Library, is stored then that Customer Library from this TPG will be included in each TPG that is loaded from this point on if user selects to update editable libraries on the window opened from Project Group-\>Options (see below).

*Warning*: Use caution when upgrading editable libraries, especially the Contractor, Customer and User libraries, to prevent data loss or inconsistency in project data. For example, you may have a project in ProjectGroup1.tpg that has customer John Smith, who is customer \#3 in the Customer library. While working on ProjectGroup2.tpg, you choose to store its Customer library to the internal library depository. In that version of the library, customer \#3 is Tom Brown. If you replace the Customer library in ProjectGroup1 with the Customer library from ProjectGroup2

using the TREAT library upgrade feature, then all projects in ProjectGroup1 that referenced John Smith will now have Tom Brown as a customer. Information for John Smith will be lost.

**Utility Bill Analysis**

TREAT allows calculating average non-HVAC (base) load and heating slope (building heat loss rate) by analyzing utility bills alongside with daily outdoor temperatures during the billing periods. As with any statistical calculations, it is important to have large amount of reliable billing data available in order to get meaningful results. We recommend that you have at least twelve actual utility bills available for each analyzed fuel. If a fuel is used for both base and HVAC load, then the bills must be available for the months without noticeable heating and/or cooling.

You do not have to create a building energy model to run billing analysis.

The Heating Energy Scorecard and the Investment Guidelines for Heating reports show the results of billing analysis performed independently of the model. The Heating Energy Scorecard report demonstrates how your building performs relative to other typical buildings. The Investment Guidelines for Heating report calculates cost effective investment for specified target heating energy consumption and payback. TREAT normalizes billing data based on the calculated heating and cooling degree days per time period. TREAT does not perform regression analysis of the bills. The user has to specify heating and cooling reference temperatures if billing analysis is run independently from the building model. In this case the

accuracy of the billing analysis strongly depends on the reliability of the assumptions.

You must have daily weather data available for the building location and the periods covered by the utility bills before billing analysis may be performed. The required data may be downloaded from http://www.engr.udayton.edu/weather/ , a website which contains files of daily weather data for many cities. The files may be imported into TREAT by clicking the *Import* button on the Daily Weather Library screen. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the import or refer to the Daily Weather Import section of this manual.

**Validation of Entries – Model Review**

The ***Model Inspector*** examines the data that has been entered for the base building and improvement packages to catch common data input errors. The verifications are general rules designed to check that the input data has a minimum level of consistency with a logical building model and with TREAT calculation algorithms. Review the warnings on every tab of Model Inspector and modify project inputs as needed.

The ***Feedback Panel*** shows if the heating, cooling and base load calculated for the model is close to the billing numbers (if billing analysis was performed). Click the True Up Help button for advice on how to reconcile the model and billing outputs.

Review ***Design Heating and Cooling Loads Report*** to see that the load is distributed between the spaces as you would expect.

Review the ***Model Energy Report*** to see that the building energy consumption and losses due to the different factors are reasonable.

The ***Evaluated Options*** section may only be used after the Building Model screens are filled out. Use the screens in this section to evaluate the effect of improvements on annual energy costs. You can run the Model Inspector for every package that you create.

**Input Screens**

****Foundation Depth Below Grade**** input is available if the foundation type is basement or crawlspace. Enter the average depth of the foundation floor below grade in this field. For example, if the basement foundation depth below grade is set to 4 ft., then each basement wall will be described as two wall sections in the TREAT project. One section will be 4 ft. high and adjacent to ground; the other will be 3 ft. high (basement ceiling height of 7 ft. minus foundation depth of 4 ft.) and adjacent to outdoors. If foundation depth is greater than the default ceiling height for the space, then TREAT will assume that ceiling height of the space is equal to the foundation depth and only the below-grade portion of the wall will be generated. That would correspond to a space that is entirely below grade.

****Long Term Weather Site**** input is essential for both billing and energy model sections. Select the location closest to your building from the list of sites supported by TREAT. Your selection will direct the program to the appropriate TMY2 weather file that contains information on typical climatic conditions for every hour of the year. The file is generated based on hourly meteorological data collected for the 30-year period from 1961-1990. 12 typical months for each station were chosen from statistics determined by using five elements: global horizontal radiation, direct normal radiation, dry bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and wind speed.

****Heating Season**** and ****Cooling Season**** input determines the months during which heating and cooling systems are available. Heating energy usage during the months that are not part of heating season is equal to zero, even if there is non-zero heating load during these months. TREAT assumes that heating starts on the first day of the heating season start month and ends on the last day of the heating season end month. The same rule applies to cooling.

Heating and cooling season input affects both model and billing calculations. Heating and cooling seasons may overlap, for example you may specify heating and cooling season from January to December. Some months may belong to neither heating nor cooling season. Heating season input also affects the way natural ventilation is calculated.

****Energy Model Calculation Mode**** box allows selecting the algorithms used for energy analysis. You may select one of the two available Surface Conductance Algorithms:

-   *R-value +heat capacity for heavy walls* algorithm is the optimized version of Layer-by-layer mode used in the versions prior to TREAT 2.5. The algorithm evaluates the material layers in each surface in the project and models each layer either as pure thermal resistance or as thermal mass, depending on layer thickness and material properties. Thermal mass characterizes the ability of material to store significant amounts of thermal energy and delay heat transfer through a building component. This delay leads to several important results, such as lower energy consumption and moving energy demand to off-peak periods. The effect of thermal mass is most noticeable in climates with large daily temperature fluctuations. In heating-dominated climates thermal mass may be used effectively to collect and store solar gains. TREAT Home Energy Rating System Building Energy Simulation Test (HERS BESTEST) testing was performed in this mode.

-   *Pure resistances (R-values)* algorithm does not account for the influence of thermal mass. This mode was referred to as "Minimize Calculation Time" mode in the versions prior to TREAT 2.5. The mode is retained in order to support projects that were created with the older versions. It is not recommended for new projects since the R-value + heat capacity for heavy walls algorithm provides more accurate results and comparable calculation speed.

R-value +heat capacity for heavy walls mode is the default mode for all projects created in TREAT 2.5 or later. For all projects created in the prior TREAT versions calculation mode is set to Pure resistance.

**Default Values**

Default Values inputs allow the user to speed up the data entry for the energy model. The default value applies only to the components that are created after the default is set. For example, changing the default wall constructions will not affect walls that are already entered in the project, but each new wall created after the default was set would have the new default construction.

-   *Default Wall Construction* - Wall construction selected on this screen is by default assigned to each new wall that is created on Surfaces/Walls screen. The default value may be edited for each wall on Surfaces/Walls screen.

-   *Default Window Frame Type* and *Glazing Type*. - Window frame/glazing that you select on this screen will, by default, be assigned to each new window entered on the Windows screen.

-   *Default Door Type* - The door type that you select on this screen will, by default, be assigned to each new door created on the Doors screen.

-   *Default Ceiling Height* - The value entered here is used as the default ceiling height of each new space that you create on the Spaces screen.

-   *Stories* input is only used for reports. *Number of Dwelling Units* input is used in domestic hot water demand calculations.

-   *Total Number of Occupants* is used in domestic hot water demand calculations and for establishing fresh air requirements.

-   *Default Building Air Tightness* sets the value of Estimated Seasonal Air Changes per Hour in the Heated Area Infiltration section of the Infiltration screen.

-   *Roof Color* and *Wall Color* input is used to set solar absorptivity of exterior surfaces.

-   *Total Number of Bedrooms* input is used to calculate domestic hot water load for Home Energy Rating System (HERS).

-   *Use window shades in summer* checkbox allows the user to specify seasonal window shading. If the box is checked then the shading factor (or SHGC) of all windows in the building are reduced by 20% compared to the value for an un-shaded window entered on Windows screen for all months that are part of cooling season. Using this option reduces building cooling load

-   *Advanced* button - This button allows the user to fine tune the energy model inputs:

-   *Shielding Class* strongly affects infiltration calculations if Detailed Infiltration algorithm is used.

-   *Entering Cold Water Temperature* is used in domestic hot water calculations for the model.

-   *Cooling Latent Load* is used for the load sizing and cooling energy calculations.

-   *Common Wall Area* is used in calculation of HERS rating of attached homes.

-   *Average Lighting Load Wh/SqFt-Day* is used in Model Inspector to verify accuracy of lighting inputs.

-   *Account for climate impact on HSPF and SEER* checkbox adjusts the manufacturer-specified HSPF and SEER to account for site climate. The nameplate HSPF for a heat pump is based on the temperature in Climate Region IV () and the minimum Design Heating Requirement () that is a function of machine heating capacity. This selection limits the contribution of resistance heating because it typically results in relatively high seasonal heating temperature. Site specific HSPF varies significantly with climate.

> All unitary air conditioners are rated using EER, a rating standardized by , which reports steady-state efficiency at 95oF outdoor and 80oF indoor temperature. Smaller air conditioners (i.e., \< 65,000 Btu/h) are also rated using SEER, intended to better indicate average seasonal performance. However, for single-speed equipment, SEER is simply estimated as the EER at 82oF outdoor and 80oF indoor temperature condition. SEER rating de-emphasizes high temperature performance.
>
> The TREAT climate efficiency degradation algorithm accounts for variations of actual equipment efficiency based on its rated efficiency and the climate at the building site. We recommend that this adjustment is used for all TREAT projects

-   *Account for Part Load System Efficiency* checkbox adjusts model heating and cooling energy consumption to account for reduced efficiency during part load operation. The algorithm was developed based on information presented in the article “Residential Equipment Part Load Curves for Use in DOE-2” by Henderson, Huang and Parker. Part load ratio for each month was calculated by dividing monthly heating (cooling) load by the energy that the heating (cooling) system could generate at full load conditions during the same time interval. The part load adjustment is calculated for each month depending on equipment type and part load ratio during the month and varies between 0.75 and 1. If part load ratio for boilers is less than 0.1 then monthly usage is adjusted by 0.75+2.5\*PartLoadRatio. For forced air heating and cooling systems the monthly usage is adjusted by 0.75+0.25\*PartLoadRatio.

-   *Default target heating energy usage Btu/SqFt-* - This is a default target value that may be adjusted for each analysis period on the Analysis Periods screen. It is used to calculate the investment potential of the building as indicated on Heating Energy Scorecard and Investment Guidelines for Heating reports. The target is different for different buildings, however the following numbers provide a guideline:

Best new homes - 2Btu/SqFt-

Energy Star homes - 5Btu/SqFt-

Low usage existing homes - 7Btu/SqFt-

Medium usage existing homes - 11Btu/SqFt-

High usage existing homes - 15Btu/SqFt-

**Spaces**

The building can be modeled either as a single space or multiple spaces. The decision as to whether multiple spaces are necessary depends on many factors. If two spaces are operated at different temperatures (have different thermostat set points, overheated or under-heated due to distribution loss, imbalance or internal gains), different heating or cooling schedule, have different mechanical ventilation loads, or one space (perhaps an attic, basement or garage) is unconditioned, then use of multiple spaces may be necessary. If you plan to use TREAT for sizing a heating or cooling system, then each area for which the design load is of interest should be modeled as a separate space. A little experimentation will soon reveal the cases in which a more complex multi-space description is needed. If each room in the building is modeled as a separate space, the input may be very time consuming. In most single-family houses all rooms that belong to one heating/cooling zone and are serviced by one thermostat may be modeled as a single space.

**Tips:**

1. If an unheated space is vented (for example if this is a vented crawl space) you may choose not to model it as a separate unconditioned space. Instead you may enter the surfaces that are adjacent to this space (floor of the first level) as adjacent to exterior.

2. An un-vented roof cavity that will be filled with insulation may be modeled as unconditioned space.

***Walls***

-   TREAT attaches 0.68' layer of soil to walls that are 1ft high or less. Temperature of surrounding soil is assumed to be equal to the ambient air temperature for the hour.

-   TREAT attaches layer of soil equal to WallHeight\*0.77 to walls that are between 1 and 3 feet high. Soil temperature is assumed to be equal to the ambient air temperature for the hour.

-   Below grade walls that are more than 3 feet high are modeled as two separate walls. First wall is 3' high, has 2.31' layer of soil attached to it, and looses heat to ambient air temperature, Second wall is (WallHeight-3) feet high and has 3' layer of soil attached to it. Temperature of surrounding soil is assumed to be equal to average annual air temperature.

***Slab On Grade***

Slabs are modeled as two separate surfaces. First surface is 3' wide slab perimeter ring. It has 3' layer of soil attached to it. Temperature of surrounding soil is assumed to be equal to the ambient air temperature. The second surface is of the same area as the remaining section of the slab and has 3' layer of soil attached to it. The temperature of surrounding soil is assumed to be equal to the average annual air temperature.

***Slab Below Grade***

Losses are calculated from 3' perimeter ring around the slab. 9'layer of soil is attached to the perimeter wring and the temperature of surrounding soil is assumed to be equal to average annual air temperature. Layers of soil are attached to the surface in order to model insulating properties of soil. Thickness of the soil layer is selected to approximate the length of heat flow path through ground. For the typical building configurations the algorithm produces results that are very close to heat loss coefficients specified in ASHRAE Fundamentals.

***Windows***

The combination of Frame and Glazing allows the user to define a wide range of windows. The NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Counsel) has a standardized testing procedure that is used to create the ratings for U-value and SHGC (Solar Heat Gain Coefficient) that appear on the NFRC label on new windows. The NFRC ratings are for the entire fenestration product (glass and frame combined).

Smaller windows have a greater ratio of frame area to glass area than larger windows, which affects the overall rating of the window. For this reason, the NFRC uses standard sizes, residential size and nonresidential size, to compare different windows regardless of size.

If you have the NFRC ratings for U-Value and SHGC for a particular window, then you may enter these values in the Custom Window Properties dialog. Be aware that the Glazing and Framing type still play a factor in the calculations and must be entered appropriately.

TREAT calculates the U-value and SHCG for the specific sizes of windows in the building model. The SHGC and U-value for a specific window are not the same as the NFRC rated SHGC and U-value unless the window is the same size as the standard "residential" or "non-residential" sizes used to generate the NFRC ratings.

Shading ranges from 0 if there are opaque blinds covering the window to 1 for clear glass with no external or internal shading. By default the shading factor is set to the value that corresponds to the selected glazing with no additional shading. The meaning of the shading factor (SF) is similar to the shading coefficient (SC) found in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals; however, the numerical values are not the same. The shading coefficient in the ASHRAE Handbook is defined as the ratio of the solar heat gain through a given glazing assembly to that of a reference single-pane, double-strength, clear (DSA) glass. The shading factor used in TREAT is the ratio of the solar heat gain through the given assembly to the solar heat gain through a similar glazing assembly with clear glass of the same thickness. For glazing systems with only

clear glass, the shading factor is one. However, for glazing systems with tinted glass or with selective coatings, the shading factor will have a value less than one.

**Infiltration**

The following *Infiltration Algorithms* are available:

****Surface Leakage Proportional to Area**** (Detailed Infiltration) algorithm converts the input entered on Infiltration screen to the total effective air leakage area (ELA). ELA is allocated to exterior surfaces entered on Walls/Surfaces screen in proportion with the gross surface area. This algorithm accounts for influence of indoor/outdoor temperature difference, elevation of spaces and surfaces and stack effect. The energy calculations may run slower in this mode. The outputs of the algorithm depend strongly on the shape of the building. For example, in a single story building roof/ceiling may have larger surface area than exterior walls. Because of that, most of the effective air leakage area will be allocated to roof/ceiling,

which may result in exaggerated stack effect. Users may adjust the default air leakage assumptions by assigning leakage areas between specific spaces and the outdoors. This leakage area allocation algorithm will be enhanced in future versions of TREAT.

****Fixed Infiltration Rate**** algorithm assumes that the infiltration rate is unchanged throughout the year and is equal to the value specified on Infiltration screen. The mode increases calculation speed but does not account for indoor/outdoor temperature difference and stack effect. The accuracy of TREAT calculations in this mode was verified by HERS BESTEST.

Use Surface Leakage Proportional to Area algorithm for high-rise building, where the stack effect plays important role. For low-rise buildings Fixed Infiltration Rate algorithm is recommended.

There are three infiltration screens in the program.

-   The *Heated Area Infiltration* screen allows the user to enter combined infiltration of all the heated spaces to exterior and unheated areas. Input may be based on the visual inspection of the building or the blower door test measurements. By default the value is set to Air Changes per Hour based on default building air tightness specified on the Weather/Defaults screen.

-   The *Unheated Space Infiltration* screen allows the user to enter infiltration of each unheated space in the project. By default the infiltration is set to 2 ACH for unheated vented spaces and 0.5 ACH to unheated unvented spaces. Modify this value to reflect the actual air leakage. Infiltration input for unheated space is ignored if all the walls in the space are adjacent to "ground".

-   The *Holes in the Building* screen allows the user to describe the visible openings in the walls of conditioned spaces. If no input is made on this screen then the value entered on Heated Area Infiltration screen is converted to effective leakage area and allocated to surfaces adjacent to outdoors in proportion with their area. Sealing individual holes can be modeled as an improvement only if the holes are defined on this screen.

***Heating/Cooling***

TREAT allows specifying main (primary) and back-up (secondary) heating systems. The same thermostat controls both systems. The secondary system is turned on when the primary system capacity is not sufficient to satisfy the building load.

Heat plant output capacity may affect heating consumption of the building due to the following:

1. If there is no secondary heat plant in the project or if there is a secondary heat plant and secondary system control is set to operate the secondary system when primary system capacity is insufficient then model heating consumption displayed on the Feedback Panel and in reports is limited by the capacity of the heating system. In this case if the system output capacity is insufficient to satisfy building heating load, the displayed heating consumption will be lower because on cold days the temperature in the building will be less than the specified thermostat setpoint. Check the load sizing report to make sure that the building heating system is not undersized.

2. Low heat plant capacity leads to longer heat plant run time, which may increase distribution loss and hence overall heating consumption.

3. The current version of TREAT does not model the heat plant stand–by loss. Consequently, oversizing the heating system is not penalized.

***Ventilation***

The *Ventilation Rate* may be entered as total for the fan or on room-by-room basis. The total ventilation rate is distributed between the rooms that are served by the fan in proportion with the room volume.

The method described in ASHRAE Standard 136 may be used to superimpose exhaust and supply ventilation. Enter the resulting mechanical ventilation rate on the Fans screen.

***Water Heater***

TREAT uses two efficiency values for water heaters – Recovery Efficiency and either Energy Factor or Stand-by Loss.

Efficiency data for variety of water heaters is available in TREAT Water Heater library

*Recovery Efficiency* – the ratio of energy delivered to the water to the energy content of the fuel consumed by the water heater.

*Energy Factor* – a measure of water heater overall efficiency determined by comparing the energy supplied in heated water to the total daily energy consumption of the water heater.

*Standby loss* is the average hourly energy consumption divided by the average hourly heat energy contained in the stored water, expressed as percent per hour.

The following relationships may be used to calculate the Energy Factor using the Energy Guide annual usage estimate:

For gas heaters, Energy Factor = 150 / [Energy Guide Therm/year].

For electric heaters, Energy Factor = 4396 / [Energy Guide kWh/year].

The stand-by loss from combination space and domestic hot water heating systems may differ significantly between heating and non-heating seasons. TREAT allows entering two efficiency values for such systems. TREAT uses the input to calculate the average seasonal efficiency taking into account the heating season months entered on the Weather/Defaults screen. Heating season length is assumed to be 6 months if the heating season entered on the Weather/Defaults screen spans more then half the year.

For tankless water heaters you must use a very small capacity (1 gallon) and an input Btu equal to the input Btu of the boiler.

An indirect DHW tank zoned off boiler is modeled as Domestic Hot Water Improvement – Water Heater Replacement. The efficiency of the new system is the boiler efficiency minus losses off pipes and storage tank. A 7% reduction is recommended in Krigger’s Residential Energy Book. If the boiler is 93% efficient, then the new DHW systems Recovery Efficiency would be 86 (93-7=86). The input capacity of the DHW is the same as the boiler. In this case the Energy Factor would be .85 (Energy factor must be less than Recovery Efficiency divided by 100*).*

***Lighting***

According to a pilot study "Incorporating Lighting and Appliance Energy Consumption into the Home Energy Rating Score" prepared by Architectural Energy Corporation, the statistical average connected lighting load in single family houses is 1.25 W/sqft and the lamps are lit on average 2.34 hours/day.

A monitoring project commissioned by the Bonneville Power Administration and Tacoma Public Utilities referenced on LBL website (http://eetd.lbl.gov/btp/papers/38454.pdf, Tribwell and Lerman, 1996) showed similar results, with an average of 2 hours per day operating time and lighting load of 1.47 W/sqft.

When the exact lighting usage in an existing home is not known, the statistical averages presented above should be used to enter the lighting load in TREAT

Lighting load distribution throughout the day may significantly affect heating and especially cooling load.

Compare two cases – in one case a single 60W bulb is lit 24 hours/day; in the other case eight 60W bulbs are lit 3 hours during night/evening time. In both cases the lighting load is 1440Wh/day, but cooling usage on a mild summer day when cooling is needed during the day but not at night may differ significantly. In the first case the lighting increases cooling load; in the second case cooling and lighting do not interact with each other since they do not occur simultaneously.

**Load Sizing**

Inputs on this screen are used for the Design Heating and Cooling Load report.

*Furnace Heating Temperature Drop* - design temperature difference between supply and return air temperature. The value is used for duct sizing.

*Heat Pump Heating Temperature Drop* - design temperature difference between supply and return air temperature used for heat pump distribution system sizing.

*Cooling Temperature Drop* - design temperature difference between supply and return air temperature used for sizing of cooling ductwork.

*Electric Distribution Baseboard Capacity Watt/ft* - baseboard capacity per manufactures specifications used to determine the length of baseboard required to meet the space heating load.

*Boiler Temperature Drop* - design temperature difference between supply and return water. The value is used for pipe sizing.

*Hydronic Distribution Baseboard Capacity Btu/hr/ft* - baseboard capacity per manufacture specifications used to determine the length of baseboard required to meet the space heating load.

*Heating Safety Factor* – the value is used to obtain the required heating equipment output capacity as noted on the Design Heating and Cooling Load report.

*Cooling Safety Factor* – the value is used to obtain the required cooling equipment output capacity as noted on Design Heating and Cooling Load report.

*Distribution Safety Factor* - specify the safety factor in percent. The value is applied to space distribution CFM/ as noted on Design Heating and Cooling Load report.

**Note:**

TREAT load sizing has been compared to Manual J. Heating and cooling loads calculated by TREAT proved to be slightly more conservative. Please use professional judgment in applying the results to sizing heating and cooling systems.

**Other Input Screens**

**Visual Inspections**

This input area includes information gathered from on-site inspections on problems in particular areas or mechanical systems that could affect building energy performance. Additional items include details of the problem observed, recommended actions and repair costs.

**Measurements**

This screen allows you to document the results of measurements taken in the building that may be important for building energy performance. Locations include: Combustion Appliance Zone, Ductwork, Hotwater heater, Oven, Heating System, Attic, Crawspace, . Measurement types include: blower door, CO, CO2, depressurization, duct leakage, flue draft, formaldehyde, temperature. Additional items include details of the recommended actions and repair costs.

**Improvement Options**

The Evaluated Options section calculates the energy saving benefits of improvements made to the building envelope, HVAC, domestic hot water system, appliances, lighting, etc. Improvements are changes to the components that are described on the Building Model screens. TREAT allows entering multiple options for improving the same existing component.

If you plan to propose multiple improvements to the homeowner, you may group the improvements in several different packages to fit different budgets or payback periods. Interaction between improvements is accounted for when package savings are calculated.

TREAT calculates the following values for each improvement and package in the project:

-   *Cost* of improvement is taken from the user input for this improvement. Cost of a package is equal to the combined cost of all the improvements in the package.

-   *Annual Savings MMBtu* is the difference between the energy consumption of the and the building with the improvement. The energy savings are aggregated for all the fuels used in the building.

-   *Annual Savings $* is the difference between the total energy cost of the and the building with improvements.

-   *Payback, Years* is the number of years it will take for the Improvement or Package to pay for itself. It is calculated as a ratio of the improvement cost to the annual dollar savings.

-   *SIR* (savings to investment ratio) allows the user to perform a more accurate economic analysis of the improvement feasibility. It compares two alternatives: investing in the improvement versus investing in a bank CD at the specified rate for the term equal to the life of the improvement. The SIR value accounts for inflation. An SIR greater than one indicates that the improvement makes economic sense. SIR is calculated as the ratio of adjusted savings to the investment (cost) of improvement or package. Adjusted improvement savings are calculated using the following formula:

> A- calculated improvement $ savings shown on Improvements screen
>
> N - improvement life entered on Improvement Wizard screen and shown on Improvements screen
>
> e - inflation rate entered on Edit Financial Information screen
>
> i - bank rate entered on Edit Financial Information screen.
>
> The adjusted package savings are calculated as sum of adjusted improvement savings.

-   *Cash flow* is a feature of the Packages screen, not the Improvements screen. Cash flow is useful when the homeowner has to borrow money from the bank to pay for the improvement. Cash flow is calculated as the difference between the annual improvement savings and the loan payments.

The Improvements screen allows the user to create, edit or delete proposed improvements, calculate energy and dollar savings from improvements, and edit financial information. The screen displays the list of improvements created by the user.

**Lifestyle Changes**

The improvement wizard screens allow entering physical improvements to the building that are usually installed by professionals, such as replacing heating system, installing programmable thermostats, insulating an attic, etc. However, some of the energy savings may be achieved by simple changes in the lifestyle of building occupants. Turning off lights in the room when leaving, reducing shower times, replacing the furnace filter regularly, cleaning refrigerator coils and other similar actions can often produce significant energy savings with minimal or no investment.

TREAT allows estimating energy savings from occupant behavior by associating variety of lifestyle actions with each improvement entered on the Improvement Wizard screen. The inputs are made on the Lifestyle Savings window, which is accessible from the Improvements or Packages screen by clicking the *Lifestyle* *Savings* button.

The screen is divided in two sections. The upper table is non-editable and shows all improvements in the project or in the selected package, depending on the setting of the filter at the top of the screen. The lower table allows editing inputs.

**Reports**

Reports may be saved to a file using the Save shortcut on the print preview toolbar. Any TREAT user may open the file with the Open shortcut on the print preview window.

The verifications are general rules designed to check that the input and output data has a minimum level of consistency with a logical building model and with TREAT calculation algorithms. The tool was developed to catch the typical problems that were encountered by users seeking technical support.

**HOME ENERGY RATING**

TREAT is not currently one of the RESNET-accredited rating software programs. The rating score is generated by comparing the energy usage of the rated home with the reference home. The **reference home** is a hypothetical home configured in accordance with standard guidelines. It has some similarities with the house being rated, for example it has the same shape and size, same foundation type, same fuel type for heating, cooling and water heating, etc. It also differs from the actual building in many ways. The U-values of all enclosure elements are as set forth in the Model Energy Code; fenestration area is distributed uniformly in each of the four cardinal directions; the efficiency of heating, cooling and DHW equipment conforms to the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act in effect on January 1992; 80% distribution system efficiency; etc.

The **rated home** is the specific home being evaluated using actual characteristics of this home modified per operating condition assumptions outlined in the standard. Operating condition assumptions are applied to both rated and reference homes and are aimed at eliminating the bias associated with energy conservation habits of building occupants. The assumptions set such occupant-dependant model parameters as thermostat heating and cooling setpoints; internal heat gains from lighting, people and appliances; hot water consumption; etc.

The reference home has a point score of 80 on a 0 to 100 point scale. Each 5% increase or decrease in the relative energy consumption of the Rated Home in respect to the Reference Home constitute a 1 point increase or decrease in the rated home's score. Any home achieving a rating score of 86 points or greater may be labeled an Energy Star Home. In other words, Energy Star Such houses consume at least 30% less energy than corresponding reference home.

The standard requires that the Home Energy Rating Report contain energy consumption of all non-rated energy consuming devices such as lighting and appliances. Actual efficiency of these devices is not considered and usage estimates are based on the Standard guidelines. Refer to the standard for more details on how the rating is calculated.

**The Appliance Survey** allows entering quantities and types of appliances in the rated house. The survey is not linked to the inputs made on the Appliances and Lighting screens because of the specifics of HERS requirements. For example, the standard establishes fixed energy usage per appliance which depends on appliance type and may be different from the energy consumption of the appliances found on site. The standard also requires that some appliances (dishwasher, dryer, etc.) are included in the rating even if they are not present in the house but the house has dedicated space/wiring/piping for the appliance. Refer to the Non-rated Energy Consuming Devices section of the standard for more details on how to fill out the

appliance survey.

Frequently Asked Questions (from TREAT website)
-----------------------------------------------

**How do I model mechanical ventilation in a multifamily building?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Multifamily buildings often have multiple forms of mechanical ventilation: a common area ventilating fan which includes corridors and stairs, plus individual fans serving the kitchens and bathrooms within each apartment which may be ducted to a single exhaust. The mechanical room will often have a fresh air intake fan.

The corridors should be modeled as a space.

All apartments should be modeled as a space. The basement mechanical room should be modeled as a space.

Assign a mechanical ventilation fan that serves “all apartments” with a ventilation rate equal to the sum of all individual kitchen/bath fans (80 CFM \*10 units = 800CFM). Set the operating hours to reflect behavior. Assign a separate fan to specify ventilation for the corridors as fixed CFM or ACH to model corridor ventilation. Follow the same steps for the fresh air makeup fan in the mechanical room. The result is three separate fans serving three separate spaces (common area, apartments, mechanical room).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To model a rim joist, create a basement with 7’ high walls adjacent to Ground. Then create a 1’ high wall adjacent to Outdoors (TREAT version 2.0 and later include rim joist as a separate surface type). In a simple rectangular structure this creates a basement with 8 walls - 4 adjacent to ground and 4 adjacent to Outdoors. The rim joists have been defined and now can be insulated. Also add an Infiltration Reduction Improvement, because insulating and sealing the rim joists affects infiltration into the basement. Combine the Rim Joist Insulation Improvement and Rim Joist Air Sealing Improvement into a single Package. Otherwise, TREAT will only calculate the change in R-value and savings will be too low.

**Do I have to enter all the lighting and appliances if I am performing insulation and HVAC improvements? Are there any shortcuts?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typically lights and appliances give off enough heat to affect the amount of energy used to heat and cool a building, and they must be accounted for in modeling the building.

Lighting Load: According to a pilot study prepared by Architectural Energy Corporation, statistical average connected lighting load in single family houses is 1.25 W/sq ft and the lamps are lit on average 2.34hours/day. You may use this statistic for your input as follows: if space area is 800 sq ft, enter single 1000W fixture that is lit 2.34 hours per day. If the calculated wattage is too high and exceeds TREAT upper limit for this field, you may use count field to specify total wattage. Note that your inputs may differ from average values, for example common area lights in multifamily buildings are usually lit 24 hours a day.

Appliance Load: You may use Appliance Library to enter reasonable appliance load – make sure that all typical appliances are entered and the specified annual usage is realistic.

**If an existing building does not have air conditioning can it be added as an improvement?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This can be modeled by putting AC in the base building, but setting the thermostat setpoint very high and the pre-retrofit AC efficiency very high. This will minimize or eliminate existing AC usage. Then create a Cooling System Improvement with AC that you want to install, and an Indoor Temperature Control Improvement with the proper temperature setpoint. Combine both Improvements into a Package. Energy savings will be negative, denoting an increase in kWh use, but it should model this situation well, as a work-around.

Another way to do it is to enter the proposed AC system in the base building with capacity equal to 1Btu/hr, the smallest allowed by TREAT. Enter a heating/cooling thermostat for the base building with realistic cooling setpoints. Existing building cooling usage will be limited by system capacity, so it will be close to 0.

Then create a cooling system improvement and enter the actual AC capacity. This Improvement will model cooling usage, without needing to create a Package.

**Can I add a new fuel type as an improvement?**
------------------------------------------------

Yes. For example, your building has electric heat and you want to change it to natural gas. To model that you need to enter electricity and natural gas on the Fuels/Rates screen. Then you may create a Heat Plant Improvement and specify natural gas as the new heating fuel.

**How do I model the reduced infiltration that results from window replacement?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create 2 improvements and combine them into a package. Window Replacement Improvement assumes only a change in R-value and solar gain. Infiltration Improvement is needed if there is also a reduction in infiltration as a result of replacing windows. Combining both in a package will account for the lesser savings from reduced infiltration due to the greater insulation of the building envelope with the new windows. Give the infiltration improvement a cost of $1. SIR of the package will be the SIR of the window replacement project.

**When I create a Surface Improvement that installs wall insulation, why does the Total Improved Area include the area of the windows and doors in that wall?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is because the Total Improved Area, Sq Ft is used to calculate the total cost of the surface insulation by multiplying by the unit cost. It was felt that any insulation material savings at the window openings would be offset by the increased labor at the window openings. The Total Improved Area, Sq Ft is only used to calculate the total price of the improvement and is not used in energy calculations.

**I modeled an improvement where the cash flow was negative and the payback about 16 or 17 years, but the SIR was greater than 1. How can that be?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIR compares two options: investing money in the improvement OR keeping money in the bank and earning interest for the life of improvement. SIR depends on improvement cost, energy savings, OF IMPROVEMENT and DISCOUNT . Discount rate is calculated based on inflation and rate of a competing investment (specified by user). SIR greater than one indicates that you are better off investing in the improvement.

Cash flow evaluates the following scenario: you had to take a loan from bank to finance the improvement. The loan amount is equal to improvement cost. User specifies the loan term and rate. Each year you have to pay the bank a certain amount to pay off the loan. Each year you save money due to reduced energy consumption of your building. The difference between the two is annual cash flow. Cash flow depends on improvement cost, energy savings, LOAN TERM, and LOAN INTEREST . There is no direct connection between SIR and cash flow.

<span id="_Toc29789869" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc7328801" class="anchor"></span></span>**Why don’t total room loads add up to equipment capacity on the Design Heating and Cooling Loads report?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The equipment capacity is not equal to the sum of the room loads because TREAT calculates the peak simultaneous load on the building, which typically does not coincide with the peak load on each room. The difference between space load and equipment load is covered in notes 3 and 5 of the report.

**On the Design Heating and Cooling Loads report, how was building load turned into equipment capacity, using the equipment and distribution efficiencies, and the safety factor?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required Output Capacity = Building Load \* Safety Factor / Distribution Efficiency

This logic is described in Note 5 on the report.

**When we put in an AFUE figure for efficiency, the Design Heating and Cooling Loads report often displays a line in red text, “HEATING SYSTEM IS UNDERSIZED DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIRED HEATING LOAD”. Isn’t this false, as most of these buildings are in fact overheated?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no contradiction here. On a typical day the building may be overheated due to system imbalance, high distribution losses, inadequate heating control, etc. However, on a few days when outdoor temperature falls to design heating conditions the building may become under-heated.

Also, as part of load sizing, TREAT applies user-specified heating safety factor to required heating input. Default value for the factor is 25%. TREAT reports insufficient heating system capacity if the load is met but not exceeded by the specified safety factor. You may choose to reduce the safety factor to compensate for difference between steady state efficiency and AFUE for load sizing.

**On the Percentage Improvement Report, it looks like I'm saving more than the building’s total usage, how can that be?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Percentage column on this report shows the percentage of energy used, not the percentage of energy saved. In this case, “Total Package” has a percentage of 108.5. This means that if "Total Package" is implemented, then the building model will use 8.5% more energy than it would use without the improvements contained in "Total Package". Using more energy is sometimes OK if there is a large reduction in the price of the energy.

For example, converting a building from electric heat to gas heat. Electric heat is 100% efficient, all energy is delivered to the heated space, but the energy is expensive. Gas heat may be 80% efficient due to chimney losses and duct leakage into unconditioned spaces so 120% more energy (fuel) will be required to be put into the system to achieve the same results, but the cost of the energy is 67% less, so it saves a lot of money.

**Is there a way to export a TREAT report to a word application?**
------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="_Toc7427125" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc24180933" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc24515509" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc39047937" class="anchor"></span></span></span></span>Only for Users with theCSV Package Export custom feature. This utility allows TREAT users to export fuel usage information for selected package to a text file in comma separated format (.csv). The file may be imported into a spreadsheet program for additional calculations or into word processor for generating custom reports. The selected package must have calculated results for the entire package and each included improvement.

The generated file will overwrite any existing files with the same name (for the same project and package). However, you may create files for other packages and projects without overwriting information that was previously extracted.

**Tip:** Double-click the csv file to open it in MSExcel. You may also open the file in Word. To improve the file appearance in Word you may select an individual section of the file (for example, the rows starting with Building Address and ending with Zip) and then select Table-\>Insert Table to replace commas with table grid.

**What is the reality check message saying that the reference temperature of 36.83 F is not in the expected interval, when I have not mentioned this value as a reference temperature anywhere?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reference temperature is calculated by TREAT based on your model inputs. Reference temperature of 36F means that your building requires heating only when the outdoor temperature falls below 36F. This is unusually low. Typical reasons for such a low value are very high heat gains from lighting, appliances or DHW along with very low infiltration/mechanical ventilation rate and high wall R-values.

**HOME ENERGY RATING CERTIFICATION**

EnergyGauge, REM/Rate, and TREAT are accredited by Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET) to be used for Home Energy Rating System (HERS) ratings. To be accredited, an application must be developed to comply with the “2006 Mortgage Industry National Home Energy Rating System Standards” (Mortgage, 2006) and pass a software verification test suite to verify tool accuracy and comparability. Descriptions of the tests from the verification test suite, taken from “Procedures for Verification of RESNET Accredited HERS Software Tools” (Procedures, 2006), are listed below.

1.  **Tier one of the HERS BESTEST** – HERS BESTEST was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for testing the building load prediction accuracy of simulation software. HERS Building Energy Simulation Test (HERS BESTEST) is a procedure for comparing HERS output to the output of “several of the best public-domain, state-of-the-art building energy simulation programs available in the ” (NREL, 1995). These programs currently are BLAST 3.0 Level 215, DOE2.1E-W54, and SERIRES/SUNCODE 5.7. Very simple houses in two locations ( and ) are simulated with these “state-of-the-art” programs using standard HERS assumptions for occupancy and physical properties. The same houses are simulated with the HERS tool being tested. In order to pass the test, the HERS estimate for heating and cooling load (in MBtu/y) must be within a certain percentage of the estimate from the “state-of-the-art” programs for each of these hypothetical houses. (See Section 3.1 of the *Procedure* *for Verification*.)

2.  **HERS Reference Home auto-generation tests** – These tests verify the ability of the software tool to automatically generate the HERS Reference Home. (See Section 3.2 of the *Procedure for Verification*.)

3.  **HERS method tests** – These tests verify that software tools can accurately calculate the HERS Index that is used as the numerical indicator of relative performance for a home. (See Section 3.3 of the *Procedure for Verification*.)

4.  **HVAC tests** – These tests verify the accuracy and consistency with which software tools predict the performance of HVAC equipment, including furnaces, air conditioners, and air source heat pumps. (See Section 3.4 of the *Procedure for Verification*.)

5.  **Duct distribution system efficiency tests** – These tests verify the accuracy with which software tools calculate air distribution system losses. ASHRAE Standard 152 results are used as the basis for the test suite acceptance criteria. (See Section 3.5 of the *Procedure for Verification*.)

6.  **Hot water system performance tests** – These tests determines the ability of the software to accurately predict hot water system energy use. (See Section 3.6 of the *Procedure for Verification*.)

**RESPONSES FROM CERTIFIED ENERGY RATING PROVIDERS**

**John Coulter**

**Advanced Energy**

(phone conversation)

Advanced Energy has used REM/ for 5-6 years as a provider and rater; have found it very user friendly and the developers are very responsive to their needs

has a program called “System Vision” that includes Energy Star rating plus combustion efficiency and ventilation/duct sealing. Advanced Energy guarantees heating and cooling costs for first two years, so they are concerned that the actual costs come close to predicted. They compared Manual J load calcs (using Right-Soft) to REM/ and earlier versions of REM/ did not come as close to actuals but current version is much better and they are comfortable using it. Advanced Energy did a comparison of Energy Gauge and REM/ and found them to be very similar in their output calcs.

REM/ is not a load calc program and if that is required you should use a different program, such as Right-Soft or Elite. There is better software for alternative energy analysis. REM/RATE’s internal calcs seem to favor larger homes meeting Energy Star levels better than smaller homes

Summary:

1.  Choose a program that provides energy use and another program that provides heating and cooling modeling when those details are needed.

2.  Decide how much you really want to be involved in the design of energy use software as opposed to its field applications. Advanced Energy chose to go with REM/ even though they could do their own because they want to focus on the field work.

The SystemVision™ Energy Guarantee Program, offered by the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency in partnership with Advanced Energy Corporation, encourages high standards of energy efficiency in the construction of affordable homes.

The Agency will provide a construction subsidy of $4,000 to nonprofits and local governments for each home they develop following SystemVision™ guidelines. The guidelines include specific energy efficiency standards such as smart mechanical ventilation systems that control indoor air quality and humidity levels. Advanced Energy Corporation trains the construction teams in the implementation of these systems.

Under the SystemVision™ Program, Advanced Energy issues a two-year heating and cooling bill guarantee. Typically, this guarantee is that the average heating and cooling costs will be less than $30 per month. If the actual costs are higher, Advanced Energy reimburses the homeowner for the excess. Advanced Energy also issues a comfort guarantee to the homeowner: the center of every room will differ from the thermostat setting by no more than three degrees.

It would be wiser to adopt a program that has programmers working full time on incorporating new energy products, services, etc., than trying to keep up with it yourself.  I don’t think you want to be in the energy efficiency software business.  It’s competitive, and takes a bunch of work.

We use REMRate (Architectural Energy Corporation, talk to Dave Roberts) which is most widely used throughout the , and Micropas which is for , which as you know has the highest residential energy efficiency requirements in the nation. These programs do give you somewhat different results for the same inputs. REMRate does not address . We use the software for energy star certifications, Title 24 in CA, Federal Tax Credit certifications, and for any other residential energy target any municipality might have anywhere.

How we would change it is a long discussion because we are actually doing in the field the work that software companies are trying to model into their software, and they need constant feedback on different products and techniques, etc., though it difficult to incorporate changes into software readily, so you sometime don’t get a real world result from the algorithms used in the software.  For example, it has taken years to more correctly model the impact of radiant barrier on a home.  There are other products that have no rating because the testing needed for the software has not been done, yet these products do have a favorable impact on the energy efficiency of the home.  The software does not know it, nor take it into account.

It is very important to note that experience in using these programs is very critical.  The more plans you do, the more you learn about the software and the many things that you can do to make a house energy efficient.  Our company has done about 122,000 plans and counting, which may be the most of any provider/rater in the nation, and as such we can use software in ways that would take most a long time to learn.

**Oregon Department of Energy**

The State of and the "lower four" northwest states generally favor program designs that rely upon prescriptive measure implementation. Oregon and Washington have building codes that are prescriptive in nature, and our compliance surveys routinely find much better compliance with code requirements than is found in many other parts of the country, where performance-base approaches (like ratings) are allowed to demonstrate code compliance. Our region's Energy Star Homes program is based upon prescriptive measures that were first modeled on "prototype" homes that are intended to be representative of typical construction in the region. This way, the program’s staff have been able to focus upon the materials and technologies we wish to promote into common use without the added cost of running software on each home under construction. We have found the RESNET-approved software is not sophisticated enough to generate particularly useful energy use, equipment sizing or duct system design information.

 

For utility-run weatherization programs we have come to much the same conclusion. When one goes into a home, it typically falls into a general class of homes where the measures recommended are the same. We know that certain measures prove to be cost effective time and time again while others tend not to be worthwhile except in certain situations. We have established "deemed" savings for a whole menu of measures based upon studied savings in outfitted homes. Spending time to run modeling software on each home to tell an auditor what she already knows is a worse investment than putting that auditor in the field to work with contractors to ensure the highest quality work possible and help homeowners manage the weatherization process with minimal headache and life disruption.

 

Our low-income programs are a different story. In that arena they use the software runs to document and justify the funds spent on weatherization and the energy savings being claimed on a house-by-house basis.

 

In short, unless you rely heavily upon the analysis reports, I suggest you consider keeping whatever software use to the program and measure development realm and focus on putting knowledgeable people in the field to actually work at improving the value of work done in either new construction or weatherization programs. That way you can use more sophisticated analysis on a more limited basis to develop defensible measures without having to police numerous rating runs, each one susceptible to input error or building mis-representation.

 

Just two cents from "down south." Good luck.

Wisconsin Energy Star Homes

Predominately we use Rem Rate to qualify homes in our new construction program (Wisconsin ENERGY Homes) - as a prerequisite before going in

the field with the builder. Homes must meet 80 rating index (or lower)

based on plans before we proceed with verifying construction details and as

built condition. Also, it is used some in the existing homes program

where there is customer demand. Last year we did 1500 ratings in new

construction and only 200 in existing homes. More assessments are done in

existing homes because you don't need a rating to tell you to insulate un/under insulated walls, attics, etc and the rating $ can actually go towards the improvement measure.

WE DO NOT use REM for evaluated or reported program savings

3. How or if you would change it?

I think the software is fine for what we use it for. Most of the changes

I would suggest are directed at RESNET in interpreting ventilation run time and default distribution efficiency for duct work located inside conditioned

space.

1. *What software program you use?*

Architectual Energy's RemRate, version 12.31

 

2. *How you use it for your particular programs?*

We use it solely for our Residential New Construction program to:

> a.  Rating for Estar Performance score (in Climate zone 6, 80 points or less)
>
> b.  Verification of EPACT 2005
>
> c.  's Energy Code Compliance.  allows for a rating to be used to show code compliance.  Must be 85 points or below.

 

3. *How or if you would change it?*

a.  We would like a more elegant database.  The existing "Export Database" is unwieldy.  We are happy there is one, and we continue to make progress in learning its usefulness though.

 

b.  We would like for data to be able to be imported directly into the software in order to run a rating.  ie, there is field collected data that is common for all houses.  RemRate would be very useful if you could import this data directly to the software thus reducing rekeying information.

 

c.  Reports, there are near 100 possible reports.  It would be very good if the reporting structure were more dynamic, ie, be able to build your own.

 

d.  Dynamic entry of building component properties.  An easy example:  Windows come in many combinations of U and SHGC factors.  RemRate does not allow you to dynamically enter in the factors.  Instead, its a pick list from a clunky library system.  Many other building components are like this too.

 

If I think of more, I'll send them your way. 

 

A huge plus for the software is that the staff at are very responsive and helpful.

1. *What software program you use*: REM/Rate

2. *How you use it for your particular programs*: Ratings and Energy Star certifications

3. *How or if you would change it?*: all changes and upgrades are handled by software developer- they are very open to suggestions- we have submitted minor changes and suggestions to them as they have been needed.

We use REM/Rate as our software for Energy Star Homes ratings. It is easy to use and folks in neighboring states also use it - so we can exchange information and learn from one another.

Many of us do not use REM/Rate for other work, such as multifamily audits or weatherization assistances and training.

There are many things that we would like to see change. REM/Rate continues to use heating degree-days rather than a more sophisticated way of representing weather - such as bin data. Also some of us would like to see the Manual J calculations come closer to what other Manual J programs give.

1. *What software program you use?*

Architectural Energy Corp’s REM/Rate

2. *How you use it for your particular programs?*

For all HERS Ratings. Primarily for ENERGY certification purposes, but also to show compliance with the 2005 EPAct Tax Credit. Occasionally we use the ratings for improvement analysis and Energy Improvement Mortgages.

3. *How or if you would change it?*

AEC has amazing customer support I can not say enough about their technical support team. The one thing I would change, however, is how the software models multifamily units and buildings. It seems like that is the one area where some improvement could be achieved.

**Terry Smith, Director**

**Installed**

1. *What software program you use*: REMrate - TREAT (soon)

2. *How you use it for your particular programs*:  Most of our work is for either Energy Star or the 2005 EPACT tax credit. We have a pilot with the Touchstone Energy Cooperatives where they use our services for a bill guarantee program (new construction).  These Touchstone Homes get E-Star and Tax Credit as well. 

 

We are also beginning a Home Improvement with Energy Star program in northern where we will use TREAT software  

3. *How or if you would change it?*: The REM software feeds into a tracking and certificate printing tool that we have developed with a consultant.  So, as we need changes we have been able to work with Architectural Energy Corp to meet our needs. (I've been using REM for about 10 years now), they have been very good to work with.

**Paul Rimelspach**

REM/Rate – I’ve used REM/Design since 1992 for upgrades, training, ratings, marketing, etc.

I think modeling software should be linked to CAD and/or more directly to HVAC sizing programs – we’re all crunching the same numbers in slightly different scenarios – not an efficient use of resources.

I was in for my daughter’s Sun marathon a couple of years ago; you have an awesome country up there! Good luck with your search.

**Joe Bowling**

**Energy Wise Solutions, Inc**

1- We use REM/ from Architectural Engineering

2- We use it for Energy Efficient Mortgages(EEM),

energy improvment audits and Energy Star Audits.

3- We are a fairly new provider, therefore we have not

had much to complain about yet.

**Energy Efficient Homes **

As an approved RESNET provider, would you be willing to tell us

 

1. What software program you use  REM/Rate

2. How you use it for your particular programs, and   Ratings

3. How or if you would change it?    NO

**Brett Dillon, Vice President**

**Builders Energy Rater**

**Suite1**

We use REM/Rate for all of our HERS ratings on new and existing homes.  I have found it to be the most user friendly program while maintaining the accuracy level needed.  We even use the results generated by the software to guarantee energy consumption for heating and cooling for some of our production builder clients.

I am also the VP of IBS Advisors,LLC, and we have recently received RESNET approval as a HERS Training Provider.  I have been teaching the HERS courses for the past 3 years as a subcontracted trainer, and all of those clients also used REM/Rate.

The developer of REM/Rate has been particularly helpful when dealing with “bugs” that are inevitable whenever a new version of the software is released and also provides updates whenever the latest regulations are released by RESNET to accommodate compliance.

The one thing that I would change with REM/Rate is the geothermal section.  The default values listed are outdated and they need to capture more data on soil conditions, in my opinion. Hope this helps!
