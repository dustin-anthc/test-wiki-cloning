## [Weatherization Energy Audit Submittal Requirements](/wiki/Images/Weatherization Energy Audit Submittal Requirements.pdf)

This U.S. Department of Energy program notice describes the minimum requirements energy auditing tools need to meet in order to be approved for use in the federal Weatherization Assistance Program.  

## Analytic Methods

### Energy Estimation Methodology

- What energy estimating method is used?


- What format of climatic data is used?  If degree-day weather data is used, what base temperature is used and why?  Which weather data sites are used by different subgrantees in the Grantee territory?
- Are existing energy use and energy requirements of the dwelling determined from actual energy bills, by generally accepted engineering calculations, or optionally, both?
- Does the energy audit address all significant heating and cooling loads?
- How are conductive, convective, and radiative heat losses (or gains) estimated?
- How is the energy consumption of heating and cooling equipment estimated during the audit for pre- and post-weatherization?

> Energy consumption of heating and cooling equipment is estimated in one of three ways:
> 

1. The User may choose a heating system from a supplied list.  These heating systems each have  using the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency metric that has either ... [[Heating Systems|Space-Heating-and-Cooling-Energy-Calculations#heating-systems]]

- How are blower door readings and the results of other tests used by the energy estimating method?
- Does the energy audit software address domestic hot water and/or household appliance measures?  If so, how is the energy estimated for these end uses?
- Are estimated fuel/energy cost savings discounted to net present value?
- For multifamily audits what internal verification feature, such as trueing-up the model with actual energy consumption, does the audit use to validate each audit, or how does the Grantee otherwise ensure that the building is properly modeled?


### Measure Interaction

- Describe how the energy audit tool accounts for the interaction between architectural and mechanical measures.
- Provide audit results of a sample dwelling unit to document that, when moving from an architectural to a mechanical measure, the energy audit tool adjusts the estimated fuel cost savings of measures with lower, non-interacted savings-to-investment ratios...
