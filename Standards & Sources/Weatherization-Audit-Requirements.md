## [Weatherization Energy Audit Submittal Requirements](/wiki/Images/Weatherization Energy Audit Submittal Requirements.pdf)

This U.S. Department of Energy program notice describes the minimum requirements energy auditing tools need to meet in order to be approved for use in the federal Weatherization Assistance Program.  

## Analytic Methods

### Energy Estimation Methodology

- What energy estimating method is used?


- What format of climatic data is used?  If degree-day weather data is used, what base temperature is used and why?  Which weather data sites are used by different subgrantees in the Grantee territory?
- Are existing energy use and energy requirements of the dwelling determined from actual energy bills, by generally accepted engineering calculations, or optionally, both?
- Does the energy audit address all significant heating and cooling loads?
- How are conductive, convective, and radiative heat losses (or gains) estimated?

>A detailed description of how AKWarm estimates heat loss can be found in the [[Heat Loss|Space-Heating-and-Cooling-Energy-Calculations#losses]] section, and gains can be found in the [[Heat Gains|Space-Heating-and-Cooling-Energy-Calculations#gains]] section.

- How is the energy consumption of heating and cooling equipment estimated during the audit for pre- and post-weatherization?

> For a detailed description, please see the section on [[Heating Systems|Space-Heating-and-Cooling-Energy-Calculations#heating-systems]] and on [[Cooling Systems|Space-Heating-and-Cooling-Energy-Calculations#cooling]].  In summary, energy consumption of heating equipment is estimated in one of three ways:
> 

>1. The user may choose a heating system from a supplied library of systems.  The energy from these heating systems is calculated using the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency metric associated with each system in the library.
>
>2.  The user may enter a certified AFUE obtained from the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute's website.  
>
>3.  The user can enter the results of a steady state combustion efficiency test, which AKWarm then converts into an AFUE by using a ratio of steady state efficiency to AFUE of a similar heating device. 



- How are blower door readings and the results of other tests used by the energy estimating method?

>Blower door tests are converted to an estimated natural air leakage rate which is then used in the heat loss calculation.  See the section on [[Natural Air Leakage|Space-Heating-and-Cooling-Energy-Calculations]] for more details.

- Does the energy audit software address domestic hot water and/or household appliance measures?  If so, how is the energy estimated for these end uses?

> AKWarm estimates energy use for household appliances so that [[internal gains|Space-Heating-and-Cooling-Calculations#gains]] are properly accounted for, but there are no options for appliance energy efficiency measures.
> Weatherization audits using AKWarm software do address domestic hot water consumption.  Estimation of energy use of systems is calculated using the method described [[here|1998-Tech-Manual#dhw]]

- Are estimated fuel/energy cost savings discounted to net present value?

> Yes, the estimated energy cost savings are discounted to net present value using the DOE discount rate which is updated annually.  Please see the section on [[Improvement Calculations|1998-Tech-Manual#improvements]] and the HERS Guidelines requirements for [[cost effectiveness inputs|HERS-Guidelines#cost-effectiveness-inputs]] for more details.  


- For multifamily audits what internal verification feature, such as trueing-up the model with actual energy consumption, does the audit use to validate each audit, or how does the Grantee otherwise ensure that the building is properly modeled?


### Measure Interaction

- Describe how the energy audit tool accounts for the interaction between architectural and mechanical measures.
- Provide audit results of a sample dwelling unit to document that, when moving from an architectural to a mechanical measure, the energy audit tool adjusts the estimated fuel cost savings of measures with lower, non-interacted savings-to-investment ratios...
