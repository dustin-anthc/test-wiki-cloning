# AKWarm Documentation

Welcome to the wiki for **AKWarm** home energy rating software.  AKWarm is a free program owned by the [Alaska Housing Finance Corporation](http://www.ahfc.us/ "AHFC Homepage") that is used to model the energy use of residential buildings in cold climates, evaluate energy efficiency improvements, and provide an energy rating.  

The wiki is divided into four main sections-- one for **technical users** of the software, one for **AKWarm developers**, a section covering **standards and sources** related to AKWarm, and a **miscellaneous** section for odds and ends related to AKWarm.
